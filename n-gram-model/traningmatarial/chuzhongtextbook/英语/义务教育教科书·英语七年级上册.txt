致同学

同学们，你们好！祝贺你们进入一个新的英语学习阶段！这套教材

将陪伴你们走过初中三年的英语学习历程，帮助你们实现更高的英语学

习目标。

这套教材是根据你们的心理特点、认知水平和兴趣爱好来编写的。

相信在今后的英语学习中，新教材的以下特点会引起你们的学习兴趣，

并对你们的英语学习有所帮助：

1.  新教材不仅要帮助你们学会一些英语语言知识，更重要的是要帮

助你们发展语言运用能力，让你们会用英语表达思想、与人交流。

2.  新教材充分考虑了你们的生活实际和学习需求，教材的内容和活
动都与你们的生活和兴趣紧密相连，目的是让你们在英语学习中不感到

枯燥乏味，做到有话可说、有话想说、有话能说。

3.  新教材不仅重视培养你们的语言能力，而且重视培养你们的学习
能力，包括自主学习能力和合作学习能力，这些能力会让你们终身受益。
4.  新教材为你们设计了许多具有交际意义的任务或活动，目的是让
你们在英语课堂上“活”起来、“动”起来。英语课堂教学需要你们的充

分参与，英语学习需要你们与老师合作、与同学交流。通过参与和互动，

你们的英语水平才会得到不断提高。

5. 学习语言和学习文化是密不可分的。因为语言是文化的载体，文化
是语言的灵魂。新教材为你们编写了大量的文化内容，包括我们的民族文

化、英语国家的文化和非英语国家的文化。通过文化内容的学习，你们的

视野会更开阔，思想会更丰富，思维会更活跃，交流会更得体。

要想学好英语，光靠课本是不够的，你们还需要接触更多的英语学习

资源。学习英语没有捷径，只有多听、多说、多读、多写、多记、多用才

是最有效的办法。因此，你们要充分利用各种资源和机会来学习英语。

同学们，加油吧！朝着你们的目标，Go for it!  祝你们英语学习取得

成功！

Notes on the Text

Starter Unit 1  Good morning!
1.  关于英语名字的性别

在英语中，人的名字大多带有性别特征。因此，一般情况下我们可以从一个人的名

字得知此人的性别。例如：Paul（保罗）是男士，Helen（海伦）是女士等。 教材后的人
名表提供了英语中常见的男、女名字。

2.  Good morning! 早上好！

Good morning!  是英语中常见的见面问候语，类似的问候语还有 Good afternoon!
（下午好）和 Good evening!（晚上好）。在英语国家的非正式场合及日常口语中，熟人及
朋友间常常用 Morning! Afternoon! 或 Evening! 进行问候。例如：

Morning, everyone! 大家早上好！
Evening, Gina. How’re you today? 晚上好，吉娜。今天可好？
但是，Good night! 并不是问候语，而是晚上分别时或就寝前的道别用语，它的含义

是“晚安！”“再见。”

Starter Unit 2  What’s this in English?
1.  a map 和 an orange

英语中不定冠词 a 和 an 用在名词的前面，泛指“一个”。大多数情况下，人们使用
不定冠词 a。例如：a key（一把钥匙）、a jacket（一件夹克衫）等。但是，当所修饰的名
词发音为元音开头时，就要用不定冠词 an。例如：an apple（一个苹果）、an egg（一个鸡
蛋）、an hour（一个小时）等。
2.  What’s this in English? 这个用英语怎么说？

在此句中，in English 中的 in 表示“使用；利用（某种语言）”。例如：What’s that in 

Chinese? 那个用汉语怎么说？

此外，英语中还可以用 What’s the English for ...? 表达同样的含义。例如：
A: What’s the English for 枕头 ? B: It’s a pillow. 
A: “枕头”用英语怎么说？ B: 是 pillow。

Starter Unit 3  What color is it?
歌谣 A-E-I-O-U

英语的 26 个字母中有 5 个元音字母，即 Aa, Ee, Ii, Oo, Uu。

55

Page PB

Notes on the TextNotes on the Text

歌谣中的介词in与What’s this in English?中的in含义不同，这里in表示“在⋯⋯之中；

在⋯⋯里边”。例如：A in Dale; E in evening的含义是“Dale中的A，evening中的E”。

Unit 1  My name’s Gina.
1.  My name’s Gina.  我的名字叫吉娜。
  What’s your name?  你叫什么名字？

这 两 个 句 子 中 的 ’s 是 英 语 单 词 is（ 是 ） 的 缩 写， 即：My name’s = My name is；
What’s = What is。此处的“’”称作缩略符，它可将两个单词缩略连接到一起，从而使
得说话时语言更加流畅、简洁。

2.  I’m Jenny. 我是珍妮。（我叫珍妮。）

这是自我介绍的另一种说法，相当于My name’s Jenny. 此处I’m 为I am 的缩写。I’m ... 

是本单元一个重要的句型，它的含义是“我是⋯⋯”。例如：

I’m your teacher. 我是你的老师。
I’m a new student. 我是一位新学生。

3.  英语国家的姓和名

英语国家的名字也有姓和名之分。但是，英语姓名和汉语姓名的位置顺序不同。在

汉语中，通常“姓”在前，“名”在后。而在英语中，通常是“名”在前，“姓”在后。

在非正式场合或熟人之间，英语国家的人往往直呼其名。在正式场合或陌生人之间，

人们通常在姓氏前面加上 Mr.（先生）、Ms.（女士）、Mrs.（夫人；太太）等称谓。例如：
Mr. Black（布莱克先生）、Ms. Green（格林女士）等。
4.  ID card  身份证；（个人身份）信息卡

ID card 是 Identity card 的简写形式。一般情况下，ID card 指公安机关发放的“身
份证”。但在学校中，ID card 也可用来特指学生的 school ID card，即学生的“个人身份
信息卡”或“学生证”。例如：

Do you have your ID card with you? 你随身带身份证了吗？
Your school ID card, please. 请出示你的学生证。

5.  公共电话号码

每个国家都会特别设定一些公共电话号码，用以提供公共服务及社会保障。例如：

在我国有 120（医疗急救电话）、110（报警电话）、114（电话查询台）、119（火警电
话）等。

Unit 2  This is my sister.
1.  中外家庭亲属成员之间称谓的文化差异

在我国，家庭亲属成员之间的称谓可体现出长幼（例如：“姐弟”和“兄妹”）、性

别（例如：“表哥”和“表姐”）、血缘关系（例如：“奶奶”和“姥姥”，“舅舅”和“伯

56

伯”），通过称呼便可得知双方的血缘关系、辈分等等。

英语国家却不一样，在称呼中对于辈分、性别、长幼、血缘等因素不做细分。例

如：grandfather 既可指“爷爷”，也可指“姥爷；外公”；sister 既可指“姐姐”，也可
指“妹妹”；uncle 和 aunt 不仅指父亲一方的兄弟、姐妹或他们的配偶，同时也指母亲
一方的兄弟、姐妹或他们的配偶；cousin 则泛指“堂兄（或弟、姊、妹）；表兄（或弟、
姊、妹）”。

2.  Jane: ... Well, have a good day!  Sally/Kate: Thanks! You, too. 
    简：……那好，愿你们（一天）玩得高兴！萨莉/ 凯特：多谢了！也祝你玩得高兴。

1）  Have a good day! 用于表达祝愿，祝愿对方一天里有好的心情和运气。该句中的

day 还可用 morning, afternoon 等词语替代。

2）You, too. 是英语中较常见的一句答语，通常表示把同样的祝愿送给对方，相当于

汉语中的“你（们）也一样！”

3.  Here are two nice photos of my family. 这儿有两张我家人的漂亮照片。

Here are ...  表示“这是…… ；这（儿）有……”，用于介绍或引入话题，也可用

Here is ... 来表示单数的概念。例如：

Here are some of my friends. 这是我的几位朋友。
4.  Coco is in my family, too. 蔻蔻也是我家中的一位成员。

Coco 可译作“蔻蔻”，是指该家庭中宠物的名字。人们喜爱饲养宠物，对宠物很有
感情，常把它们视为家庭成员。在英语表达中，人们通常用 she/her 或 he/him 称呼宠
物，而不是用代词 it 称呼。

Unit 3 
1.  Excuse me, Grace. Is this your pencil? 打扰了，格雷丝。这是你的铅笔吗？

Is this your pencil?

excuse me 相当于汉语中的“劳驾；打扰了”，常用于询问、求助或请求之前。

2.  Teacher: What about this dictionary?  Anna: It’s Helen’s. 
    老师：这本词典（是谁的）呢？安娜：是海伦的。

1）  What about ...? 用于非正式场合中对所谈话题进行反问，或向对方征求意见，表

示“……怎么样呢？”“……又如何呢？”也可以说 How about ...? 例如：

I like English. How about you? 我喜欢英语。你呢 ?
I’m busy this afternoon. What about this evening? 今天下午我比较忙。今晚怎样？
2）此处的 Helen’s 表示“海伦的”。’s 是“名词所有格”，用于名词的后边，表示

“……的”。例如：

my brother’s name  我兄弟的名字
Jack’s father and John’s uncle  杰克的爸爸和约翰的舅舅

57

Notes on the TextNotes on the Text

3.  Teacher: Thank you for your help, Anna.  Anna: You’re welcome. 
  老师：多谢你的帮助，安娜。安娜：不客气。

Thank you for ... 和 Thanks for ... 都是表达感谢的方式，在 for 的后边加上感谢的

原因。例如：

Thanks for your books. 多谢你的（那几本）书。(= Thank you for your books.)

4.  How do you spell it? 它（指某一单词）如何拼写呢？（你如何拼写它？）

英语中常用代词代替已知的名词，而不重复该词。本句中 it 代替需要拼写的单词。
用于询问或要求对方拼写单词的表达方式还有：

Can you spell it, please? 请你把它拼写出来好吗？（你能拼写它吗？）
Spell it, please. 请把它拼写出来。
Do you know how to spell it? 你知道它如何拼写吗？

5.  Lost and Found 失物招领处

在西方国家，学生一旦不小心在学校里丢失了东西，就会写一个 Lost 便条，上面
写出所丢物品以及联系方式。同样，当人们拾到了物品，会以相同的方式在纸上写一

个 Found 便条。也有些学校会专门设立一个失物招领处，例如：Lost and Found (box, 
office, room, desk ...)，便于大家找回丢失的物品。
6.  Ask the teacher for it. 去老师那里拿。（到老师那儿去领。）

ask ... for ... 表示“向某人索取某物；向某人要某物”。例如：
You can ask him for the dictionary. 你可以找他要那本词典。
Don’t ask me for it. Go and ask your father (for it). 不要向我要（它），去向你爸爸

要吧。

7.  E-mail me at maryg2@gfimail.com. （请）给我发电子邮件到maryg2@gfimail.com。
    Call me at 685-6034. （请）拨打电话 685-6034 找我。

1） at 放在电子邮箱的地址或电话号码等前面，表示“按照…… ；根据……”。例如：
Please meet me at No. 202, Xingqing Road. 请在兴庆路 202 号与我见面。
2） maryg2@gfimail.com 是一个电子邮箱地址，其中符号 @ 是 at 的缩写，读作 at，

com 前的实心点读作 dot。
8.  I must find it. 我必须找到它。（我一定要找着它。）

该句中 must 的含义是“必须”、“一定”，属于情态动词。例如：
I must go now. 现在我必须走了。
9.  a set of keys  一串钥匙；一套钥匙

a set of 表示“一套⋯⋯”、“一副⋯⋯”等。例如：
a set of books  一套书籍；一套图书
a set of music CDs  一套音乐光碟

58

Notes on the Text

Unit 4  Where’s my schoolbag?
1.  Come on, Jack! 快点儿，杰克！

Come on! 用于表示催促、鼓励、安慰等，此处表示催促，含义是“赶快；快点儿”。

英语中还可以用 Hurry (up)! 表示催促。例如：

Hurry up, David! We’re late. 赶紧啦，戴维！我们已经晚啦。

2.  I’m Kate, and my sister is Gina. 我叫凯特，我的妹妹叫吉娜。
I’m tidy, but Gina is not. 我（爱）整洁，但吉娜却不（整洁）。
以上两句中的 and 和 but 均为连词，把两个独立的短句并列连接为一个较长的句子。
英语中把这种由 and 或 but 并列连接而成的句子称为“并列句”。其中，and 表示“和；
并且；而（且）；同时”等；but 表示“但是；然而”等。例如：
We’re here, and you’re there. 我们在这边，你们在那边。
The book’s good, but not that good. 这本书是好，但并非那么好。

3.  Gina’s books are everywhere — on her bed, on the sofa and under the chair. 吉
娜的书到处都是——她的床上、沙发上、椅子底下（都有）。

句中连词 and 表示短语与短语的连接。另外，英文破折号“—”后的内容表示补充

说明。

Unit 5  Do you have a soccer ball?
1.  关于英语中球类运动的词汇
1） tennis 和 tennis ball
以上两词虽都表示“网球”，意义却不完全相同：tennis 指运动项目名称，即“网球
运动”。tennis ball 则是指具体的“球”，有单、复数之分。例如：a tennis ball（一个网
球），some tennis balls（一些网球）。

2） have a basketball 和 play basketball
have a basketball  是 指“ 有 一 个 篮 球 ”，play basketball  是 指“ 打 篮 球 ”。have a 
basketball 中的 basketball 指的是“篮球”，前面要加上不定冠词 a ；play basketball 中的
basketball 指的是“篮球运动”，不需要使用其他词汇进行限定。
2.  Hey, Helen, let’s go! 嗨，海伦，（让）我们走吧！

let’s 是 let us 的缩写，let 表示“让……”，在其后加上“人”及“所做的事”，表示
“让某人做某事”。英语口语中以 Let’s ... 开头的句子很常见，本单元中还有 Let’s play./
Let’s ask./Let’s play computer games. 等句子。

另外，let 后面的 us 还可换用其他人称。例如：
Let me get it. 让我（去）拿（它）。（我去拿。）
Please let your little brother play. 请让你的小弟弟玩玩。

59

Notes on the Text

3.  I think he has a ping-pong ball, too. 我想他也有一个乒乓球。

sound 表示“听上去⋯⋯ ；听起来⋯⋯ ；听着⋯⋯”。例如：

5.  I don’t have a soccer ball, but my brother Alan does. 我没有足球，但我哥哥艾伦有。
此句完整的表达方式是：I don’t have a soccer ball, but my brother Alan has a soccer 
ball. 为了避免重复，此处用 does 代替了 has a soccer ball，这种用法在英语中非常常见。
本单元 have 问句的回答也是省略回答。例如：

A: Do you have a baseball? B: Yes, I do. (= Yes, I have a baseball.)

6.  We play it at school with our friends. 我们和（我们的）朋友在学校踢（足球）。

1） at school 表示“在学校”。

奶奶来说挺难，但对我来说的确很简单。

Sports are good for you, for him and for her — for all of us! 体育运动对你、对他、

还有她——对我们大家来说都有好处 !

Unit 6  Do you like bananas?
1.  关于西餐食品 hamburger（汉堡包）和 salad（沙拉）

1） hamburger 简称 burger，是西方一种经典的快餐食品。传统的汉堡包是将烘制
好的圆面包从中间切开，夹入蔬菜、牛肉饼和调味酱即可。此外，人们还可以根据自

己的口味，将其做成鸡肉汉堡（chicken burger）、鱼肉汉堡（fish burger）、奶酪汉堡
（cheese burger）和时蔬汉堡（veggieburger）等各种汉堡。

2） salad 是西餐中一道经典的凉拌菜。传统的沙拉是将洗净、切成块状或片状的生
蔬菜（通常包括生菜、黄瓜和西红柿等）与沙拉酱混合，均匀搅拌即可。沙拉也有水果

沙拉（fruit salad）、土豆沙拉（potato salad）、海鲜沙拉（seafood salad）等多个品种。

60

Notes on the Text

5.  For breakfast/lunch/dinner, I like ... 早饭 / 午饭 / 晚饭我喜欢（吃）⋯⋯ 
介词 for 与一日三餐名称搭配使用时，表示各餐所吃的食物。例如：

We often eat rice for lunch. 我们午饭常吃米饭。(= For lunch, we often eat rice.)

Unit 7  How much are these socks?
1.  英语中常见的购物用语

4.  Two dollars for one pair and three dollars for two pairs. 两美元一双，三美元两双。

2） pair 表示“双；对；副；套”，通常与介词 of 搭配，表示裤子、鞋袜、手套、眼

镜等由两个相同部分组成的物品的量。例如：

a pair of trousers/shorts  一条长裤 / 短裤
two pairs of soccer shoes/socks  两双足球鞋 / 袜
many pairs of glasses  许多副眼镜
5.  Mr. Cool’s Clothes Store  酷先生服装店 

在英语中，服装店等专有名词（人名、地名、店名等）的每个单词的首字母均要大

写。例如：

No. 6 Middle School  第六中学

6.  Come and buy your clothes at our great sale! 我们在大甩卖，快来买衣服吧！

服装店吧——他们在大甩卖。

7.  We sell all our clothes at very good prices. 我们卖的所有服装价格都很优惠。

2.  So, how old are you, Alan? 那么，你多大了，艾伦？

1） so 是英语口语中人们常用的一个语气词，相当于汉语中的“于是；那么；这样一

来”，起到承上启下的作用。

2） How old are you? 是指“你多大了？”需要指出的是，在西方国家，人们大多忌
讳别人了解自己的年龄，尤其是成年女性，他们认为年龄是个人隐私，询问他人年龄是

不礼貌的。

3.  See you! 再见！

See you. 相当于 Goodbye. 英语中常见的表示道别的表达方式还有：
See you later. 过一会儿见；回头见。
See you this afternoon/evening. 今天下午（晚上）见。
See you soon. 早日见。（希望早点再见。）
See you then. 到时见。

日、纪念日以及其他有特殊意义的日期。在本单元中，School Day 表示“学校开放日；
学校活动日”，但它不是一个固定的节日，不同学校庆祝的方式也会有不同。类似的搭配

还有：

English Day  英语节；英语日
Sports Day  体育节；运动会
英、美国家的中小学校非常重视学生的课余活动，每一学年都会组织各种各样的活

动来丰富学生的生活，培养他们的社会能力。

5.  We have some interesting and fun things for you this term. 本学期我们为大家安
排了一些有趣又好玩的活动。

term 表示“学期”，this term 表示“本学期”。英语中的“学年”称作 school year。
interesting 和 fun 是近义词，但语意稍有差别。interesting 的含义是“有意思的；有

吸引力的”，fun 的含义是“逗乐的；有趣的；使人快乐的”。例如：

I find this book interesting.  我发现这本书很有意思。
This game looks fun.  这个游戏看来好玩。

6.  Your parents can come to our school. 你们的家长可以前来学校。

can 是情态动词，表示“可以；能够”。例如：
Can you help me? 你能帮我吗？
You can’t do it like this! 你不能这样做！

Unit 9  My favorite subject is science.
1.  Frank: Hi, Bob. How’s your day?  Bob: It’s OK. 
  弗兰克：你好，鲍勃！今天过得如何？鲍勃：还行吧。

How’s your day? 是非正式场合朋友见面时的问候用语，表示“今天过得如何？”例

如：

A: How’s your day? B: Great. Today’s my day! 
A: 今天可好？ B: 棒极了！今天太爽了！

2.  I like Monday because I have P.E. and history. 我喜欢星期一，因为我上体育课和
历史课。

此处 have 与学科名称搭配，表示“上某一学科的课”。例如：
We have P.E. on Tuesday and Thursday. 我们周二和周四上体育课。
在第五单元中出现了 have 表示“有；拥有”的用法，have 还可以与其他名词搭配，

表示不同含义。例如：

have a class/lesson  上课 
have breakfast/lunch/dinner  吃早 / 中 / 晚饭 
have a soccer game  举行足球比赛 
have a party  举办聚会

3.  Because the next day is Saturday! 因为第二天是星期六！

the next day 表示“接下来的那一天；紧接着的那一天”，相当于汉语中的“第二

天”。例如：

We had a bad time that day, but the next day’s trip was pretty good. 
那天我们玩得一点都不开心，但第二天的旅行却很好。

4.  That’s for sure. 的确如此。（那可一点不假。）

That’s for sure. 表示完全赞同他人的观点，相当于汉语中的“那是肯定的”、“确实是

这样的”或“完全没有问题”。例如： 

A: Mr. Wang’s English class is very interesting. B: That’s for sure. 
A: 王老师的英语课非常有趣。B: 的确如此。

5.  Lunch is from 12:00 to 1:00, ...  十二点钟到一点钟为午餐（时间），⋯⋯ 

介词短语 from ... to ... 表示“从⋯⋯到⋯⋯”，用来表述时间、地点等范围。例如：
from Monday to Friday  从周一至周五

64

Notes on the Text

from Beijing to Shanghai  从北京到上海

6.  关于英文书信和电子邮件

在英语中，书信和电子邮件均属于应用文，有正式和非正式文体之分。本单元中的

书信和电子邮件均为非正式文体，由称谓、正文和落款三部分构成。

称谓：在书信开头，通常要在对方的名字前冠以 Dear。而在电子邮件中，还常使用
Hi。另外，在称谓之后应使用逗号（这与汉语不同，不用冒号），然后另起段落书写正文。
正文：由一段或若干段组成，可以采用每段首行缩进的方式，或采用每段齐头的方

式开始段落；如采用齐头式，段与段之间要空行。

落款：较为传统或偏正式的落款一般是在写信人自己的名字前冠以 Your friend, 
Yours 等，并用逗号将其与名字隔开，或另行书写名字。非正式的方式是直接在结尾写上
自己的名字，这种方式在电子邮件中较为常见。

7.  Our Chinese teacher, Mrs. Wang, is great fun. 我们的语文老师王老师是个很有意
思的人。

此句中 fun 的用法不是形容词，而是一个名词，表示“有意思的人；逗人开心的人；

有趣的人”。在这种用法中，fun 前面可搭配 great，good 等词。例如：

Tom’s good fun; we all enjoy being with him.  汤姆是个很有趣的人；我们都喜欢和

他在一起。

8.  My classes finish at 1:50, but after that I have an art lesson for two hours. 我学
校的课（下午）一点五十分结束，但随后我要上两个小时的美术课。

1） class 和 lesson ：
当表示“学校的课”时，class 和 lesson 区别不大，美式英语中常用 class，英式英语

中常用 lesson。例如：

Classes start at 9 o’clock.（ 学 校 ） 九 点 开 始 上 课。（ 英 式 英 语：Lessons start at 9 

o’clock.)

当表示“某种技能、技巧性的课程”时，常用 lesson，较少用 class。例如：piano 

lessons  钢琴课，driving lessons  驾驶课。

当表示“教材中的教学单元；课”时，常用 lesson。class 则还有“班；班级”的含

义。例如：

Now, Class, please open your books to Lesson 9.  同学们，现在请打开书，翻到第

九课。

2） an art lesson for two hours 表示“一节两小时的美术课”，此句中的介词 for 表示

“持续某段时间”。例如：

I have a class/lesson for 45 minutes at school. What about you? 
我的学校一节课四十五分钟。你们（学校）呢？ 
Every day, we have sports for about one hour at school. 

65

Page PB

Notes on the Text

每天我们在学校进行一小时左右的体育活动。

9.  Is that OK with you? 那对你来说合适吗？

本句用来征求对方的意见，其中 that 指代所需征求意见的内容，依据上下文的不同

也可使用 this 或 it。例如：

They want us to come. I can go. Is it OK with you? 
他们想要我们一同前往。我可以去，你也可以去吗？

Let’s eat hamburgers for lunch. Is this OK with you?
我们午饭吃汉堡包吧。你看可以吗？

英语不同于汉语，它是拼音文字，读音和拼写之间有直接的联系。因此，掌握英语语

音基本知识是学好英语的基础。在本套教材七年级上、下册以及八年级上册中，我们结合

每个单元的内容，设计了“音素学习——由字母或字母组合到读音——由读音到拼写”这

三轮拼读规则训练，帮助同学们掌握单词的拼读规则。另外，我们还设计了一些最基本的

朗读技巧训练，帮助同学们打好语音基础。

I.  字母发音

英语共有 44 个音素，其中元音 20 个，辅音 24 个，另外还有四个辅音连缀（/ts/, 
/dz/, /tr/, /dr/）。英语辅音和元音的作用相当于汉语中的声母和韵母。记录英语音素的

符号叫做音标，音标放在两条斜线（/ /）内，以免和字母混淆。

1.  元音

IV.  英音和美音的读音简要对比

情  况

英  音

美  音

1. 当字母 r 出现在元音字母组合中时，
美式英语有强烈的儿化音。

sport /spO:t/
card /kA:d/
first /f3:st/

sport /spO:rt/
card /kA:rd/
first /f3:rst/

2. 当英式英语中元音字母a 读/A:/时，
在美式英语中读 /{/，但有的词除外，
例如：father，calm。

ask /A:sk/
after /A:ft@(r)/

ask /{sk/
after /{ft@(r)/

3. 英式英语中长短音比较明确，而美
式英语中基本上不分长短音，短元音
可以读成长元音，例如：
在英式英语中许多单词读作/Q/ 的，
在美式英语中读作/A:/ 或/O:/。

box /bQks/
sock /sQk/
long /lQN/
want /wQnt/

box /bA:ks/
sock /sA:k/
long /lO:N/
want /wA:nt; wO:nt/

V.  朗读基本知识 

1.  单词重音（Word Stress）
英语单词有单音节词、双音节词和多音节词之分。含有一个响亮音素的声音片断叫

做一个音节。英语里的元音都是响亮的音素。由一个音节构成的词叫做单音节词，例如：

hi，mom，dad，first，meet 等等。由两个或两个以上音节构成的词称为双音节词或多
音节词。对于双音节词或多音节词，有的音节须读得重些，叫做重读音节；有的音节要

读得轻些，叫做非重读音节。重读音节用重音符号“  ”标出。

双音节词的重音一般落在第一个音节上，例如：

jacket /dZ{kIt/，question /kwestS@n/，sweater /swet@(r)/
少数双音节词的重音在第二个音节上，例如：

excuse /Ikskju:z/，July /dZulaI/，about /@baUt/ 
三音节词的重音一般也在第一个音节上，例如：

favorite /feIv@rIt/，vegetable /vedZt@bl/，interesting /Intr@stIN/
少数三音节词的重音在第二个音节上，例如：

computer /k@mpju:t@(r)/，tomato /t@mA:t@U/ (/t@meIt@U/)，December 

/dIsemb@(r)/

有的双音节词和多音节词有两个重音，一个是主重音，一个是次重音。次重音用“   ”

表示，标在次重音的左下方。例如：

thirteen /T3:(r)ti:n/，fifteen /fIfti:n/，afternoon /A:ft@nu:n/ (/{ft@rnu:n/)

78

Pronunciation

2.  连读（Liaison）
在同一个意群中，前后相连的两个单词之间，前一个单词末尾的辅音和后一个单词词

首的元音有时可连起来读，这种现象称为连读。连读现象是在语言交际中，特别是随着语

速的加快而自然产生的，可用符号“ ”表示。常见的连读情况有：

1)  辅音＋元音
前一个词的词尾是辅音，后一个词以元音开头，这时两个词可以连读。例如：

It’s a good idea. 

Come on, Jack! 

Is it on the desk?

Look at it. 

Let me get it. 

Can you play games with us?

2)  r/re ＋元音
前一个词的词尾是 r 或 re，后一个词的词首是元音，这时两个词可以连读，中间增加

一个 /r/ 音。例如：

Ask the teacher for it. 

I need a pair of sports shoes for school.

III.  冠词（Articles）

冠词是置于名词之前，说明名词所表示的人或事物的一种虚词。冠词不能离开名词而

单独存在。冠词包括定冠词、不定冠词和零冠词三类。

1.  定冠词（the） ：the 通常有明确的所指，即以说话人和听话人已知的人或事物为
前提，可与单数可数名词、复数可数名词或不可数名词放在一起使用。例如：The white 
model plane is hers. Where are the keys? The milk is on the table. 定冠词 the 在辅音前
读 /D@/，在元音前读 /Di/，特别强调时，可读作 /Di:/。

2.  不定冠词 （a/an） ：a/an 有不确定的意义，即所说的人或事物对听者或读者来说可
能是不知道的，其中 an 放在以元音开头的名词前面，如 an apple。不定冠词只能与单数
可数名词结合，基本含义有 “ 该类中的一例 ”、“ 只有一个 ”、“ 每一个 ” 等。例如：Do you 
have a volleyball? It’s an orange. I take the medicine twice a day.

3.  零冠词：即不使用冠词。一般来说，在复数可数名词、不可数名词或专有名词前
不使用冠词。例如：Hamburgers are not healthy. I like ice-cream. My friend is in China.

物主代词是表示所有关系的代词，分为形容词性物主代词和名词性物主代词两种。形

容词性物主代词相当于形容词，置于名词之前做定语。如：my name, your birthday, their 
parents。名词性物主代词相当于名词，不能用于名词前，说话时要加重语气。例如：A: Is 
this your green pen?  B: No, it isn’t. The blue pen is mine.

VI.  一般现在时（Simple Present Tense）

一 般 现 在 时 可 表 示 现 在 的 状 态， 例 如：I’m twelve. Where’s the schoolbag? I have 
three ping-pong balls and two ping-pong bats.  还可表示经常的或习惯性的动作，例如：
“Where’s my schoolbag?” Gina always asks. I don’t play sports — I only watch them on 
TV.  亦可表示主语具备的性格和能力等，例如：Bill likes beef, but he doesn’t like chicken.

谓语动词在一般现在时中的使用情况如下：

1.  动词be（Verb to be） 
连系动词 be 是表示谓语关系的动词，它的后面必须加表语 （通常为名词、形容词或
介词短语） 。在一般现在时中，be 动词有三种形式：am （用在第一人称单数，即 I 后） ，is 
（用在第三人称单数，即he，she，it 后） ，are （用在第二人称you 以及第一、三人称复数
we，they 后） 。 含有be 动词的一般现在时的疑问句是将be 动词提到句首，否定句是在be
动词后加not，见下表：

 肯定式

I am ... 
You are ... 
He/She/It is ... 
We/You/They are ...

否定式

I am not ...
You are not ...
He/She/It is not ...
We/You/They are not ...

89

Page PB

Grammar

Am I ...?
  Yes, you are.
  No, you are not.
Are we ...?
  Yes, we/you are.
  No, we/you are not.

疑问式和简略答语

Are you ...?
  Yes, I am.
  No, I am not.
Are you ...?
  Yes, we are.
  No, we are not.

Is he/she/it ...?
  Yes, he/she/it is.
  No, he/she/it is not.
Are they ...?
  Yes, they are.
  No, they are not.

在口语中经常使用的缩略形式如下：

肯定式

否定式

其  他

I’m = I am
you’re = you are
he’s = he is
she’s = she is
it’s = it is
we’re = we are
they’re = they are

aren’t = are not
isn’t = is not

that’s = that is
what’s = what is
who’s = who is
who’re = who are
where’s = where is
my name’s = my name is

2.  实义动词 do（Verb to do） 
实义动词是表示动作或状态的词。英语动词是词类中最复杂的一种，谓语动词的人称

和数必须与主语保持一致。此外，它们还有时态、语态、语气等变化。在一般现在时中，

除第三人称单数外，谓语动词用原形。主语是第三人称单数时，谓语动词要相应变化。含

有实义动词的一般现在时的疑问句、否定句中要借助助动词do 或does。详见下表： 

肯定式

否定式

I like oranges.
You like oranges.
He/She likes oranges.
We/You/They like oranges.

I do not like oranges.
You do not like oranges.
He/She does not like oranges.
We/You/They do not like oranges.

疑问式和简略答语

Do you like oranges?
  Yes, I do.
  No, I do not.
Do you like oranges?
  Yes, we do.
  No, we do not.

Does he/she like oranges?
  Yes, he/she does.
  No, he/she does not.
Do they like oranges?
  Yes, they do.
  No, they do not.

Do I like oranges?
  Yes, you do.
  No, you do not.
Do we like oranges?
  Yes, we/you do.
  No, we/you do not.

90

在口语中，do not 经常缩略为don’t，does not 经常缩略为doesn’t。
当主语是第三人称单数时，谓语动词有下列几种变化形式：

类  别

构成方法

例  词

读  音

help — helps /helps/

VII. 介词（Prepositions） 

介词一般用于名词或代词前，表示该词与句子其他成分的关系。介词后面的名词或代

词称为介词宾语。介词和介词宾语一起构成介词短语。

在本册书中出现的含有介词的主要短语如下：

for: 

after: 
at: 

about:  what about 
think about
after class 
at school  
e-mail me at ...

VIII. 句子种类（Sentence Types）

英语句子按照用途可分为以下四类：

种  类

用  途

例  句

陈述句 用于说明事实或说话人的看法

疑问句 用于提出问题

祈使句

用于表示请求、命令、劝告、
建议等

感叹句 用于表达强烈的感情

My name is Jenny Green.
I like him because he always plays games with us.
Hamburgers are not healthy.
I think history is interesting.

Are you Jenny?
Do you like ice-cream?
How much are those yellow socks?
When is your mother’s birthday?

Spell it, please.
Come and buy your clothes at our great sale!
Let’s play basketball.
Please come next week.

What a fine day it is!
How clean the classroom is!
Have a good day, Jane!

陈述句包括肯定结构和否定结构，在肯定结构中，谓语动词不含否定词，否定结构在

be 动词、助动词或情态动词后加not，常用缩略形式。陈述句句末用句号。

疑问句包括一般疑问句、特殊疑问句、选择疑问句、附加疑问句等。其中一般疑问句和

特殊疑问句的解释见下页，其他疑问句将在后面的册次学习。疑问句句末用问号。

祈使句的结构与陈述句一样，但主语常常省略，谓语动词用原形。祈使句的否定结构

用don’t 加动词原形形式，句末用句号或感叹号。

感叹句句末常用感叹号。将感叹词 what 或 how 及其所修饰的词置于句首，即可构成
感叹句。what 后接名词，how 后接形容词或副词，其他部分用陈述句语序。陈述句句末
加感叹号，朗读时加强语气亦可构成感叹句。

Grammar

疑问句（Questions）
1.  一般疑问句（Yes/No Questions）
一般疑问句是在句子中用提问的方式提供一些信息，要求对方用Yes 或No 回答的疑
问句。在答语中通常重复问句里的be 动词、助动词或情态动词，完全否定时口语中通常使
用缩略词，例如：aren’t, doesn’t。例句如下：

A: Is this your pencil?  B: Yes, it is./No, it isn’t.
A: Do you have a soccer ball?  B: Yes, I do./No, I don’t.
A: Does she like tomatoes?  B: Yes, she does./No, she doesn’t.
当然，一般疑问句的回答有时可以省去Yes 或No，或者补充更多信息，例如：
A: Do you like salad?  B: Yes, I really like it.
A: Do you have a tennis ball, Jane?  B: Sorry, I don’t.
2.  特殊疑问句（Wh- Questions） 
特殊疑问句是以特殊疑问词开始的以寻求信息为目的的疑问句。常见的特殊疑问词包

括：what （什么） ，who （谁） ，where （在哪里） ，when （何时） ，why （为什么） ，how 
（如何） 等。例句如下：

A: What’s your name?  B: My name’s Alan.
A: What’s your favorite subject?  B: My favorite subject is P.E.
A: Who’re they?  B: They’re my grandparents.
A: Who’s your P.E. teacher?  B: Mr. Hu. 
A: Where are my books?  B: They’re on the sofa.
A: When is your birthday, Linda?  B: It’s on May 2nd.
A: When is Sally’s birthday party?  B: It’s on October 5th.
A: When is the class?  B: On Monday and Wednesday.
A: Why do you like P.E.?  B: Because it’s fun.
A: How much is this T-shirt?  B: It’s seven dollars.
A: How old are you?  B: I’m thirteen.
在特殊疑问句中，疑问词与后面的 be 动词或助动词常用缩略形式，例如：what’s，

where’s。

特殊疑问句既可以使用完整答语，其中名词常用代词替代，也可以只回答提问部分，

例如：

A: What’s your phone number?  B: It’s 587-6275.
A: How much are they?  B: Thirty-nine dollars.

后  记

本册教科书是人民教育出版社课程教材研究所英语课程教材研究开发中心依据教育部

《义务教育英语课程标准》（2011年版）与美国圣智学习集团合作编写的，经国家基础教

育课程教材专家工作委员会2012年审查通过。

本册教科书集中反映了基础教育教科书研究与实验的成果，凝聚了参与课改实验的教

育专家、学科专家、教研人员以及一线教师的集体智慧。我们感谢所有对教科书的编写、

出版提供过帮助与支持的同仁和社会各界朋友。

本册教科书出版之前，我们通过多种渠道与教科书选用作品（包括照片、画作）的作

者进行了联系，得到了他们的大力支持。对此，我们表示衷心的感谢！但仍有部分作者未

能取得联系，恳请入选作品的作者与我们联系，以便支付稿酬。

我们真诚地希望广大教师、学生及家长在使用本册教科书的过程中提出宝贵意见，并

将这些意见和建议及时反馈给我们。让我们携起手来，共同完成义务教育教材建设工作！
