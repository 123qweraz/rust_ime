Did Jane have a good time on Monday? What about on Tuesday?

Monday, July 15th
I arrived in Penang in Malaysia this morning with 
my family. It was sunny and hot, so we decided to 
go to the beach near our hotel. My sister and I tried 
paragliding. I felt like I was a bird. It was so  
exciting! For lunch, we had something very special —  
Malaysian yellow noodles. Th  ey were delicious! In 
the aft ernoon, we rode bicycles to Georgetown. Th  ere 
are a lot of new buildings now, but many of the old   

buildings are still there. In Weld Quay, a really old place in Georgetown, we 
saw the houses of the Chinese traders fr om 100 years ago. I wonder what 
life was like here in the past. I really enjoyed walking around the town.

Tuesday, July 16th

What a diff erence a day makes! My father and I decided to go to  
Penang Hill today. We wanted to walk up to the top, but then it started 
raining a litt le so we decided to take the train. We waited over an hour 
for the train because there were too many people. When we got to the top, 
it was raining really hard. We didn’t have an umbrella so we were wet 
and cold. It was terrible! And because of 
the bad weather, we couldn’t see anything 
below. My father didn’t bring enough 
money, so we only had one bowl of rice 
and some fi sh. Th  e food tasted great      
because I was so hungry!

What Do No. 5 High School Students Do in Th  eir Free Time?

Last month we asked our students about their free time activities. Our questions were 
about exercise, use of the Internet and watching TV. Here are the results. 

We found that only fi ft een percent of our students exercise every day. Forty-fi ve  
percent exercise four to six times a week. Twenty percent exercise only one to three 
times a week. And twenty percent do not exercise at all!

We all know that many students oft en go online, but we were surprised that ninety 
percent of them use the Internet every day. Th  e other ten percent use it at least three 
or four times a week. Most students use it for fun and not for homework.

Th  e answers to our questions about watching television were also interesting. Only two 
percent of the students watch TV one to three times a week. Th  irteen percent watch TV 
four to six times a week. And eighty-fi ve percent watch TV every day! Although many 
students like to watch sports, game shows are the most popular.

It is good to relax by using the Internet or watching game shows, but we think the best 
way to relax is through exercise. It is healthy for the mind and the body. Exercise such as 
playing sports is fun, and you can spend time with your friends and family as you play 
together. And remember, “Old habits die hard.” So start exercising before it’s too late!

Are you healthy?

Oh, I’m very
healthy.

What’s your
favorite exercise?

Wow!

I like to play
basketball.

My friend David is more hard-working than me, but I am funnier than him.

2b Should friends be the same or diﬀ erent? Read about what these people 

think. Underline the comparative words and phrases in the passages.

My mother told me 
a good friend is like 
a mirror. I’m quieter 
and more serious 
than most kids. 
Th  at’s why I like 
reading books and 
I study harder in 

Jeff   Green

class. My best friend Yuan Li is quiet 
too, so we enjoy studying together. 
I’m shy so it’s not easy for me to make 
friends. But I think friends are like 
books — you don’t need a lot of them 
as long as they’re good.

It’s not necessary to be 
the same. My best friend 
Larry is quite diff erent 
from me. He is taller and 
more outgoing than me. 
We both like sports, but 
he plays tennis bett er, so he always wins. 
However, Larry oft en helps to bring out the 
best in me. So I’m gett ing bett er at tennis. 
Larry is much less hard-working, though. 
I always get bett er grades than he does, so 
maybe I should help him more.

Huang Lei

I don’t really care if my friends are the same as 
me or diff erent. My favorite saying is, “A true 
friend reaches for your hand and touches your 
heart.” My best friend Carol is really kind and 
very funny. In fact, she’s funnier than anyone 
I know. I broke my arm last year but she made 
me laugh and feel bett er. We can talk about and share everything. 
I know she cares about me because she’s always there to listen.

Who’s Got Talent?

Everyone is good at something, but some people are truly talented. It’s 
always interesting to watch other people show their talents. Talent shows 
are gett ing more and more popular. First, there were shows like American 
Idol and America’s Got Talent. Now, there are similar shows around the 
world, such as China’s Got Talent.

All these shows have one thing in common: 
Th  ey try to look for the best singers, the most 
talented dancers, the most exciting magicians, 
the funniest actors and so on. All kinds of 
people join these shows. But who can play the 
piano the best or sing the most beautifully? 
Th  at’s up to you to decide. When people watch 
the show, they usually play a role in deciding 
the winner. And the winner always gets a very 
good prize. 

However, not everybody enjoys watching these shows. Some think that 
the lives of the performers are made up. For example, some people say they 
are poor farmers, but in fact they are just actors. However, if you don’t take 
these shows too seriously, they are fun to watch. And one great thing about 
them is that they give people a way to make their dreams come true.

When people say “culture”, we 
think of art and history. But one 
very famous symbol in American 
culture is a cartoon. We all know 
and love the black mouse with 
two large round ears — Mickey 
Mouse. Over 80 years ago, he fi rst 
appeared in the cartoon Steamboat Willie. When this cartoon came 
out in New York on November 18, 1928, it was the fi rst cartoon with 
sound and music. Th  e man behind Mickey was Walt Disney. He 
became very rich and successful. In the 1930s, he made 87 cartoons 
with Mickey.

Some people might ask how this cartoon animal became so popular. 
One of the main reasons is that Mickey was like a common man, but he 
always tried to face any danger. In his early fi lms, Mickey was unlucky 
and had many problems such as losing his house or girlfriend, Minnie. 
However, he was always ready to try his best. People went to the 
cinema to see the “litt le man” win. Most of them wanted to be like 
Mickey.

On November 18, 1978, Mickey became the fi rst cartoon character 
to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Today’s cartoons are 
usually not so simple as litt le Mickey Mouse, but everyone still knows 
and loves him. Who has a pair of ears more famous than Mickey’s?

Do You Th  ink You Will Have Your Own Robot?

When we watch movies about the future, we sometimes see robots. Th  ey 
are usually like human servants. Th  ey help with the housework and do 
jobs like working in dirty or dangerous places.

Today there are already robots working in factories. Some can help to build 
cars, and they do simple jobs over and over again. Fewer people will do such 
jobs in the future because they are boring, but robots will never get bored.

Scientists are now trying to make 
robots look like humans and do the 
same things as we do. Some robots 
in Japan can walk and dance. Th  ey 
are fun to watch. However, some 
scientists believe that although we 
can make robots move like people, 
it will be diﬃ  cult to make them 
really think like a human. For example, scientist James White thinks that 
robots will never be able to wake up and know where they are. But many 
scientists disagree with Mr. White. Th  ey think that robots will even be 
able to talk like humans in 25 to 50 years. 

Some scientists believe that there will be more robots in the future. However, 
they agree it may take hundreds of years. Th  ese new robots will have many 
diﬀ erent shapes. Some will look like humans, and others might look like 
animals. In India, for example, scientists made robots that look like snakes. If 
buildings fall down with people inside, these snake robots can help look for 
people under the buildings. Th  is was not possible 20 years ago, but computers 
and rockets also seemed impossible 100 years ago. We never know what will 
happen in the future!

festival is always on the fourth Thursday 
in November, but in Canada it falls on the 
second Monday in October. Thanksgiving is 
a time to give thanks for food in the autumn 
and other good things people enjoy in life. 
Families see Thanksgiving as a time to get 
together and usually celebrate it with a big 
family meal. The main dish of this meal is 
almost always turkey, a large bird. To go 
with the turkey, people often prepare other 
things, such as gravy, cornbread, mashed 
potatoes, and pumpkin or apple pie. 

Making a turkey dinner
Here is one way to make turkey for a 
Thanksgiving dinner.

  First, mix together some bread pieces, 

onions, salt and pepper.

  Next, fill the turkey with this bread mix.

  Then, put the turkey in a hot oven and 

cook it for a few hours.

  When it is ready, place the turkey on a 
large plate and cover it with gravy.

  Finally, cut the turkey into thin pieces 
and eat the meat with vegetables like 
carrots and potatoes.

Hi David,
What a great idea! I really like Ms. Steen a lot. She helped me to improve my 
English so much. I’m sad to see her go, and this party is the best way to say 
“Thank you and goodbye.” I can help to buy some of the food and drinks. I 
can also help to bring Ms. Steen to the party. I already have a great idea about 
how to do that. 
He Wei

Hi David,
Thanks so much for planning this. I’d love to come to the party, but I’m not 
available. My family is taking a trip to Wuhan at the end of this month to visit 
my aunt and uncle. However, I’d still be glad to help out with any of the party 
preparations, like planning the games. Let me know if you need my help.

Dear classmates,
As I’m sure you know by now, our favorite teacher, Ms. Steen, is leaving 
soon to go back to the US. We’re very sad that she’s leaving because she is a 
fun teacher. To show how much we’re going to miss her, let’s have a surprise 
party for her next Friday the 28th!
Can you come to the party? If so, can you help with any of these things? 
Please tell me by this Friday.
1)  Buy food and drinks.
2)  Think of games to play.
3)  Prepare things we need for the games (glue, 

 paper, pens, ...).

4)  Bring Ms. Steen to the party without telling  

 her so that she can be surprised.
I look forward to hearing from you all.
David

b.  If people have problems, they should 

talk to other people.

Students these days oft en have a lot of worries. 
Sometimes they have problems with their 
schoolwork, and sometimes with their 
friends. What can they do about this? 
Some people believe the worst thing is to 
do nothing. Laura Mills, a teenager from 
London, agrees. “Problems and worries are normal in life,” says Laura. “But 
I think talking to someone helps a lot. Unless we talk to someone, we’ll 
certainly feel worse.”

Laura once lost her wallet, and worried for days. She was afraid to tell her 
parents about it. She even walked three miles to school each day because she 
didn’t have any money. She just kept thinking, “If I tell my parents, they’ll be 
angry!” In the end, she talked to her parents and they were really understanding. 
Her dad said he sometimes made careless mistakes himself. Th  ey got her a 
new wallet and asked her to be more careful. “I will always remember to share 
my problems in the future!” Laura says.

Robert Hunt advises students about common problems. He feels the same 
way as Laura. “It is best not to run away from our problems. We should always 
try to solve them.” He thinks the fi rst step is to fi nd someone you trust to talk 
to. Th  is person doesn’t need to be an expert like himself. Students oft en forget 
that their parents have more experience, and are always there to help them. In 
English, we say that sharing a problem is like cutt ing it in half. So you’re halfway 
to solving a problem just by talking to someone about it!

Notes on the Text

Unit 1  Where did you go on vacation?
1.  Central Park 中央公园（美国纽约）

中央公园位于美国纽约中心的曼哈顿地区，是纽约最大的都市公园，四季皆有不同的

美丽景致，独享纽约“后花园”之美称。它不仅是纽约市民心目中的休闲胜地，也是世界

各地游客向往的著名公园。

2.  Did you buy anything special? 你买了什么特别的东西吗？ 

在 英 语 中，anything, something, nothing 和 everything 是 用 于 指 代 事 物 的 复 合 不
定代词，与之相对应的复合不定代词 anyone, someone, no one 和 everyone（anybody, 
somebody, nobody 和 everybody）用于指人。与形容词连用时，形容词必须置于复合不
定代词之后，语法上称作“后置”。例如：

I can see someone new in your group. 我看出你们小组中有新人。
There’s nothing interesting in the news today. 今天的新闻里没有什么有趣的内容。

3.  Penang Hill（槟城山）和Weld Quay（海墘街）

槟城山位于马来西亚槟城岛，距离中心城区乔治市（Georgetown）约 6 公里，它的

主峰高830 米。

海墘（qiWn）街是槟城渡轮码头及其附近的一片地区，这里既有历史遗迹，也不乏现

代建筑。游客可在此处观赏槟城景致、品尝特色美食。

4.  What a difference a day makes! 一天的差异是多么大呀！

这是一个感叹句，因为强调名词，所以句首用what。又如：
What a lovely day! 多么好的一天啊！
What nice people they are! 他们是多么好的人呀！

5.  And because of the bad weather, we couldn’t see anything below. 并且因为糟糕的
天气，底下的东西我们什么都看不到。

because of 和 because 均为“因为”的意思，两者区别在于前者是短语介词，后面可

接名词、代词或名词性成分，而后者是连词，后面接句子。试比较：

I can’t come to your party, Denny, because I’m going away this weekend. 丹尼，我参

加不了你的聚会啦，因为这个周末我外出不在。（because 之后为句子）

We can’t play basketball outside today because of the rain. 因为这场雨，我们今天无

法在室外打篮球了。（because of 之后为名词）

82

They are here all because of you! 他们来这儿全都是因为你呀！（because of 之后为

代词）

Notes on the Text

Unit 2  How often do you exercise?
1.  How come? 为什么呢？（怎么会呢？）

这是英语口语中的一个习语，相当于汉语“为什么；怎么会”等意思，既可独立使

用，也可在其后接句子，用来询问事情的缘由或状况。例如：

How come the sky is so blue today? 今天天怎么会这么蓝？
A: I didn’t even eat lunch today. 我今天甚至没有吃中饭。
B: Really? How come? 是吗？怎么会呢？

2.  swing dance 摇摆舞

摇摆舞是爵士舞的一种，初现于 20 世纪早期的美国，其曲调动听活泼、节奏鲜明。

听到这种音乐，人们不禁会随着它的节奏和韵律摆动身体，故而得名。

3.  The answers to our questions about watching television were also interesting. 对
我们提出的有关看电视的问题的回答也颇有意思。

1）此句的基本意思是 The answers were also interesting，主语 the answers 为复数，

故使用were。

2）请注意本句中 answer 和 question 两个名词后的介词搭配。表示“⋯⋯的答案”

时，answer 后要用介词to，这是一种固定的搭配。又如：

There’s no easy answer to this problem. 这个问题没有简单的答案。
Her answer to your question is a big “NO”! 她对你所提问题的回答就是一个大大的

“不”字！

名词question 后则往往搭配介词about，表示“有关⋯⋯的（问题）”。例如：
He asked us some questions about our daily habits. 他问了一些有关我们日常习惯

的问题。

Her questions about you were not so friendly. 她有关你的那些问题并不那么友善。
4.  Although many students like to watch sports, game shows are the most popular. 
虽然许多学生喜欢观看体育节目，但游戏类节目却是最受欢迎的。

although 是英语中的一个连词，意为“虽然；尽管”。在英语表达习惯中，当表示
“虽然⋯⋯，但是⋯⋯”这样的意思时，although 是不和but 在同一个句子中使用的。也
就是说，在同一个句子中，有although 就没有but，反之亦然。例如：

Although the car is old, it still runs well. (= The car is old, but it still runs well.) 尽管

这辆小车旧了，但是依然跑得不错。

I don’t want to go to bed, although it’s past midnight. (= It’s past midnight, but I 

83

Page PB

don’t want to go to bed.) 虽然现在已过半夜12 点了，但我却不想睡觉。
5.  Old habits die hard. 旧习难改。

这是英语中的一句谚语，  用来说明习惯一旦养成，并非朝夕可以改变，其中，die 
hard 表示“（旧习惯、传统等）难以改变；根深蒂固”。在本句中，hard 用作副词，表示
“费力地；艰难地；努力地”，又如：

It is important to work hard but we must also have time to relax. 努力地工作是重要

的，但我们也必须有时间放松。

6.  So start exercising before it’s too late! 所以赶快锻炼起来，不要等到来不及了！

it’s too late 的字面意思是“为时太晚；来不及了”，是英语的一个常用表达。例如：
Now you know you’re wrong, but it’s too late. 现在你知道你错了，但是已经太晚了。
此处it’s too late 与before 共同组成从句，表示“不要等到为时已晚；不要等到来不及

的时候；趁着还来得及”。这也是一种常见的用法，例如：

You should work harder before it’s too late to catch up. 你应当更加用功，别等到为时

过晚而赶不上了。（你现在用功还赶得上。）

I’m more outgoing than my sister.

Unit 3 
1.  That’s Tara, isn’t it? 那是塔拉，对吗？

此句是在That’s Tara. 这一陈述之后添加了一个附着的简略疑问结构，用以进行确认。
通常情况下，若陈述部分为肯定，便用否定形式进行提问；若陈述部分为否定，便用肯定

形式进行提问。又如：

There’s someone in the room, isn’t there? 房间里有人，是吧？
He didn’t say anything at the meeting, did he? 他在会上什么也没说，对吗？
We can’t say it this way, can we? 我们不能这样说，对不对？

2.  That’s why I like reading books and I study harder in class. 这便是我喜欢看书而且
在班上学习更加努力的原因。

That’s why … 可视为一个固定的句式，表示“这便是为什么…… ；这就是……的

原因”，why 的后面一般接句子。又如：

That’s why he was late this morning. 这就是他今天早上迟到的原因。

3.  … you don’t need a lot of them as long as they’re good. （朋友）不在多而贵在好。
此句话的字面意思是“只要朋友好，你并不需要许多”，实则表达了汉语“（朋友）不

在多而贵在好”这样的意思。这是本课语句表达深层含义的又一个例子。此句中 as long 
as 是一个短语连词，用来引导条件状语从句，表示“只要……”。又如：

We can talk about this as long as you want. 只要你想（谈），我们就可以谈谈这事。
It’s fine as long as you’re happy. 只要你高兴就好。

4.  I don’t really care if my friends are the same as me or different. 我并不十分在乎我
的朋友跟我一样或与我不同。

此句中 if 不是“如果”的意思，而是“是否”的意思。另外，if 之后所引导的句子是

主句I don’t really care 的谓语动词care 的宾语，故称作“宾语从句”。又如：

I don’t care if he likes it or not — I’m coming! 我不管他喜欢还是不喜欢——我会来的！
Can you tell me if I’m right, Mr. Green? 格林先生，您能告诉我我是否正确吗？
5.  A true friend reaches for your hand and touches your heart. 一个真正的朋友是在
需要时给你帮助，使你感动。

此句中的 hand 和 heart 超出了字面意思“手”和“心”，hand 已引申为“帮助；援

助”，heart 则为“情感；感受”之意。例如：

Can you give me a hand? 你能帮我一把吗？
The movie touched the hearts of all the people at the cinema. 这部电影令所有在场的

观众动容。

此处可将reach for your hand（伸手帮你一把）和touch your heart（打动你的心；令

你感动）作为整体来记忆并运用。

6.  I know she cares about me because she’s always there to listen. 我知道她关心我，
因为她随时都能够听我倾诉。

be there 表示“在别人需要帮助时，时刻准备伸手相助”，也可译为“随叫随到；不

离⋯⋯左右”。此结构之后还可以接for somebody。例如：

My parents were always there for me when I was growing up. 在我成长的过程中，我

的父母总是随时给予我帮助。

She didn’t worry too much because she knew he would always be there for her. 她并

不是太担心，因为她知道他总是会随时施以援手的。

7.  My best friend helps to bring out the best in me. 我最好的朋友（能够）帮我激发出
自己的所能。

bring out 是一个习语，意思是“使显现；使表现出”。bring out the best/worst in 

someone 意为“把某人最好（或最坏）的一面表现或显露出来”。又如：

In a basketball or soccer game, it’s important for the players to play together and 
bring out the best in each other. 在篮球或足球比赛中，队员们密切协作，使大伙儿都发挥
到极致是很重要的。

Unit 4  What’s the best movie theater?
1.  Who’s Got Talent? 谁有才华？ 

此句中 who’s 为 who has 之缩写。 have got 表示“具有；具备”之意，相当于 have。

85

Page PB

Notes on the Text

例如：

Have you got time? I’ve got something important to tell you. 你现在有空吗？我有重

要的事要告诉你。

We’ve got a lot of work to do, you see, to make our town more beautiful. 你们瞧，我

们要把我们的城市变得更加美丽的话，是有很多工作要做的。

2.  That’s up to you to decide. 那由你自己来决定。

在英语中，be up to somebody 是一个习惯用语，用来表示“由某人做出抉择”，句子

的主语通常为it，有时也用this 或that。例如：

You can join the club once or twice a week — it’s up to you. 你可以一周参加一次或

两次俱乐部的活动——这由你定。

How much should he pay? That’s up to him to decide! 他应该付多少钱？那完全由他

来决定。

3.  When people watch the show, they usually play a role in deciding the winner. 人
们看这样的节目时，通常承担着评判优胜者的角色。

play a role是一种固定表达，意为“扮演某一角色；起到某种作用”。若要进一步引出
具体的内容，后面应用介词in，表示“在某事或某个方面起到作用或承担某种角色”。例如：

John is playing the leading role in this year’s play. 今年的演出中约翰是主角。
Schools play the most important role in education. 学校在教育中起着最为重要的

作用。

4.  However, if you don’t take these shows too seriously, they are fun to watch. 但是
如果你不把这些节目太当回事，它们还是有看头的。

take 在此处有consider（认为；觉得）的意思。take someone/something seriously 就

相当于汉语“认真对待某人或某事；把某人或某事当真”的意思。又如：

He was joking, but your sister took him seriously. 他是在开玩笑，但你姐姐却（把他）

当真了。

Sometimes teachers take students’ homework too seriously. 有时老师们把学生作业

看得太重。

5.  There is something for everyone at Greenwood Park. 在绿木公园每个人都可以找
到适合自己的东西。

1） Greenwood Park 为公园名，既可意译为“绿木公园”，也可音译为“格林伍德公

园”。在此我们采用意译。

2）在上面的句子中，不定代词something 指的是人们在公园中可以根据自己的需求或

爱好找到各自喜欢的东西。该句还可译为：在绿木公园，每个人都会找到各自的所爱。

3.  However, he was always ready to try his best. 然而，他总是准备好去尽其所能。

ready to do something，表示“总是准备好做某事；总是乐意／愿意做某事”。又如：
She was always ready to listen to my problems. 她总是愿意倾听我的烦恼。
Don’t worry. I’m always ready to help you. Just ask, OK? 别担心，我随时愿意帮你。

5.  ... Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood 
Walk of  Fame. ⋯⋯米老鼠成为在好莱坞星光大道上拥有一颗星星的第一个卡通形象。

业的贡献。

6.  Today’s cartoons are usually not so simple as little Mickey Mouse, but everyone 
still knows and loves him. 现在的卡通片通常不再像米老鼠那样简单，但大家依然知道并
喜爱米老鼠。

I’m going to study computer science. 

Unit 6 
1.  The Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway. 海明威的《老人与海》。

1）此处介词by 为“由⋯⋯所著”之意。再如：a short story by Lu Xun（鲁迅的一篇
短篇小说），the music by Mozart（莫扎特写的音乐），paintings by Van Gogh（梵高的绘
画）等。

2）Hemingway（海明威，1899—1961）是世界知名的美国现代作家，曾于 1954 年

获得诺贝尔文学奖。

3）《老人与海》是海明威著名的代表作之一，故事采用叙事文学形式，弘扬了人类迎

接挑战及勇敢面对失败的英雄主义气概，成为文学经典之作。

2.  Then you can be anything you want! 那么你就能当上你想做的人了。

此句的基本意思是 you can be anything，不定代词 anything 指代未来所从事的某一

职业，you want 用来修饰 anything。
3.  Some resolutions have to do with better planning, …  有些决定与合理的规划相
关，⋯⋯

1）此句中的 planning 为名词，表示“计划；规划”等意思，如 city planning（城市
规划）等。英语中 better planning 类似汉语中的“合理规划”，指通过制订计划更有效地
达到目的。

2）have to do with 这个结构表示“与⋯⋯相关；与⋯⋯有关联或有关系”。例如：
What does this problem have to do with what we’re learning today? 这道题跟我们今

88

Notes on the Text

Unit 7  Will people have robots?
1.  Everyone should play a part in saving the earth. 每一个人都应当尽一份力来拯救
地球。

play a part in … 是一个固定结构，表示“参与⋯⋯ ；在⋯⋯中尽自己的一份力量”

的意思。例如：

She plays an active part in teaching these poor children. 她积极参加对这些贫穷孩子

的教学工作。

He didn’t play a part in making this decision. 他并没参与做出此决定。

2.  Yes, I hope so. 对，我希望如此。

此句意为 Yes, I hope there will be world peace. 句中的 so 为副词，代替了对话中上
文所说的内容，以使得语句简练。除 hope 之外，so 还常与 think（想）， believe（相信）， 
guess（猜测）等搭配，在英语口语中非常普遍。例如：
A: Is he coming to see us? 他要来看我们吗？
B: I think so. 我想是的。

3.  I sometimes see blue skies in my city, … 我有时看得到（我的）城市里的蓝天，⋯⋯

在这个句子中，skies 用作复数，表示天气或某地的天空看上去怎样，又如：
a land of blue skies and warm sunshine 一片有着蓝蓝的天空和温暖的阳光的土地
当只指“天空”时，sky 通常用单数形式，例如：
There wasn’t a cloud in the sky. 天空中万里无云。
The sun rose higher in a clear blue sky. 太阳在晴朗的蓝天上升得更高了。
The sky turned dark just before the storm. 暴风雨来临前，天空变得漆黑了。

4.  Today there are already robots working in factories. 现在已经有机器人在工厂里干
活了。

此句中working in factories 的逻辑主语是robots，但是在这个there be 句型中，谓语
动词已经有了are，所以work 就不能再作本句的谓语动词，而应用 -ing 形式。这一点在学
习和使用there be 句型时需要特别注意。 
5.  … and they do simple jobs over and over again. ⋯⋯并且它们反复地干着简单的
工作。

在此句中，over and over again 是一个固定短语，意为“反复地；多次”，还可以说

over and over。例如：

They sang the song over and over. 他们反复地唱那首歌。
He called over and over again but nobody answered. 他多次打电话但没有人接。

6.  Some robots are very human-like. 一些机器人十分像真人。

在 human-like（形似真人的；真人一样的）一词中，-like 为形容词后缀，用在名词

89

Page PB

之后，与其构成一个完整的形容词，表示“形似……的；像……一样的；类似于……

的”。又如：a bird-like building（一座像鸟一样的建筑物），a cabbage-like vegetable（一
种形似卷心菜的蔬菜），the ball-like thing on the top of the building（楼顶上那个像球一
样的东西）。

Unit 8  How do you make a banana milk shake?
1.  Then, add the cabbage, tomatoes and onion and cook for another 10 minutes. 然
后加入卷心菜、西红柿和洋葱，再煮上10 分钟。

在此句中，another 用于具体的数字之前，表示一种“追加”的功能，相当于汉语
“另一个；再追加一个”的意思。在这种用法中，another 还可用 more 来表示，但结构略
有不同。例如：课本中的 one more thing 就相当于 another thing（还有一事）。因此，本
句中another 10 minutes 也可说为10 more minutes。又如：

He stayed with us for another five days. (= He stayed with us for five more days.) 他又

跟我们一起多住了五天。

2.  OK, that’s it? 好的，这就结束了？（好的，这就完了吗？）

That’s it. 是一个固定的口语表达方式，此处用以表示某事了结、停止、结束等。又如：
Well, that’s it. We’ve finished — we can go home now.  好 了， 就 这 样 了。 我 们 结

束——现在大家可以回家了。

A: That’s it, Mrs. Carter? 卡特太太，这就算完了？
B: Yes, that’s it. You’ve done a good job, Peter. Thank you. 对，就这样了。你干得不

错，彼得，谢谢你了。

3.  Thanksgiving in North America 北美洲的感恩节

Thanksgiving 也称作Thanksgiving Day，汉语译作“感恩节”。美国的感恩节是每年
11 月的第四个星期四，加拿大感恩节则是每年 10 月的第二个星期一。北美洲的感恩节是
一个喜庆丰收、合家欢聚的重大节日。

4.  In most countries, people usually eat traditional food on special holidays. 在大多
数国家，人们通常在特殊的节日里吃传统食物。

1）此处 holiday 表示“节日”，而非“假期”的意思，指国家法定的公众性“节日；

假日”。再如：

Christmas is the most important holiday in Western countries. 圣诞节是西方国家最

为重要的节日。

2）  holiday 也有“假期”之意。作这一用法时，多为英国英语，美国则用vacation 一

词。例如：

Will you take a holiday next week? (=【美】Will you take a vacation next week?) 下周

90

91

Notes on the Text你休假吗？

The school holidays start tomorrow. (=【美】 The school vacation starts tomorrow.) 

学校明天开始放假。

5. Families see Thanksgiving as a time to get together and usually celebrate it with a 
big family meal. 人们认为感恩节是一个家庭团聚的时刻，而且通常会用一顿家庭大餐来
庆祝。

此句中see … as 的意思是“把……看作是”，其中 see 的意思是“以特定的方式考虑；

看待”。又如：

My brother sees the job as a challenge. 我哥哥把这份工作看成是一个挑战。

Unit 9  Can you come to my party?
1.  I’m sorry. I’m not available. 真抱歉，我没有空。

此句中的 available 表示“有空；不忙；有时间交谈、聊天”，其后还可用 to do 引出

具体的事情。例如：

Are you available tomorrow morning? 明天早上你有空吗？
I’m afraid I’m not available to help with the school show on the 19th. 我怕是没空来

帮着准备学校19 号的演出了。
2.  Sam isn’t leaving until next Wednesday. 萨姆要一直待到下周三才走。

在英语中，not … until … 是一个常见句型，表示“直到……才……”。在口语中，

还可使用till 代替until，构成not … till … 结构。又如：

Don’t leave today’s work till tomorrow. 不要把今天的事留到明天去做。
I didn’t go to bed last night until past midnight. 昨晚我过了午夜12 点才睡。

3.  Catch you on Monday! 礼拜一见！

这 是 英 语 中 道 别 的 又 一 种 说 法， 相 当 于 See you on Monday! 类 似 的 说 法 还 有：

Catch/See you later!（回头见！）
4.  Let’s have a surprise party for her next Friday the 28th! 我们在（本月）28 号下周
五为她举办一场惊喜聚会吧！

surprise party 是西方国家常见的一种聚会形式，是一种旨在给人带来惊喜的聚会。聚
会往往围绕一个或若干主题人物而举办，聚会的举办者事先会对主题人物保密，待其来

到聚会现场之后才意外发现大家在为自己举行聚会，因而会十分惊讶和感激。还有一种

surprise party 并没有所谓的主题人物，而是旨在娱乐，参与者在聚会当中不断遭遇各种意
外惊喜，欢乐不止。因此，surprise party 可译作“惊喜聚会”。
5.  I look forward to hearing from you all. 我期盼着你们的答复。

look forward to 是一个固定的结构，表示“期待；期盼”，其中 to 是介词，因此后面

91

Page PB

90

Notes on the TextNotes on the Text

若使用动词，要使用其-ing 形式。又如：

I look forward to your reply. 我期待你的答复。
I’m really looking forward to seeing my little grandson again. 我好期待再次见到我的

小孙子。

6.  Hope you can make it! 希望你能参加（聚会）！ 

此句中的 make it 是一个独立的表述方式，表示通过努力或经历困难后取得成功、完
成某事，可译作“成功；胜利”，但有时也要视语境及上下文灵活选用合理的词语进行翻

译，此处便是如此。又如：

If we run, we should make it. 要是我们跑的话，应该不会迟到。
Though it was difficult, they still made it. 虽然艰难，但他们依然成功了。

7.  Please reply in writing to this invitation by Friday, December 20th. 请于12 月20
日星期五前以书面方式回复此邀请。

1） reply in writing 表示“以书面的形式进行回复”。其中 reply 相当于 answer，但
要比后者更加书面化且正式许多。此处介词 in 表示方式，相当于汉语“用⋯⋯方式（形
式）”的意思。

2） reply 用作动词时，不直接跟宾语，须由介词to 引入宾语的内容，构成reply to …

结构。例如：

Did you reply to these letters? 你回复这些来信了吗？
3） 在 此 句 中， 介 词 by 意 为“ 截 止 至 ⋯⋯ ；⋯⋯ 之 前； 到 ⋯⋯ 为 止 ”。 介 词
before 也有“⋯⋯之前”的意思，但区别在于 before 不包含其后的时间，而 by 则包括。

Unit 10 
If you go to the party, you’ll have a great time!
1.  Can you give me some advice please? 能请你给我一些建议吗？

advice 相当于汉语“建议；忠告”的意思，是不可数名词，故不可添加复数词尾 -s! 

表示“一条建议；一则忠告”应说a piece of advice 或a word of advice。例如：

Let me give you a friendly word of advice. Don’t wear jeans to the interview. 我给你

提条友善的建议吧：别穿牛仔裤去面试。

That’s really a good piece of advice. 那的确是一条不错的建议。
advise 是动词，意为“提建议；给忠告”。例如本单元Section B 课文中的这个句子：

92

Robert Hunt advises students about common problems. 罗伯特·亨特就一些常见的

问题给学生们提出建议，进行指导。

2.  If people have problems, they should keep them to themselves. 如果人们有麻烦，
他们应当把这些烦恼留给自己。

此句中的动词keep 意为“保留；保存”，其后的代词them 指代 problems。在本文语

境下，keep them to themselves 意为“把问题（烦恼）埋在心底，不向他人倾诉”。

在英语中，keep 表示“保留；保存；留存”的用法十分普遍。又如：
Will you keep the keys for me while I’m away? 在我离开的这段时间里请你代为保管

钥匙好吗？

You can keep it if you like. 要是你喜欢的话，可以把它留下。

3.  She just kept thinking, “If I tell my parents, …” 她一直在想：“如果我告诉我父母的
话，……”

在此句中，keep 表示“（使……）保持（某种状态或关系）；一直……”，后面接动

词时，该动词要用-ing 的形式，形成keep doing … 结构。例如：

It kept raining for a week. 雨一直下了一个星期。
Just keep singing, and don’t stop. 接着唱，不要停下来。

4.  They got her a new wallet and asked her to be more careful. 他们给她买了一个新
钱包，还让她再小心些。

在本句中，get 意为“买”，相当于buy，但不如后者正式。再如：
Could you get me a ticket, please? 请给我买张票好吗？
I usually get vegetables from that supermarket. 我通常从那家超市买蔬菜。
I got this T-shirt for 50 yuan when it was on sale. 这件T 恤衫是我在促销时花50 块钱

买的。

5.  In English, we say that sharing a problem is like cutting it in half. 在英语中，我们
说与人分担一个烦恼就像把麻烦分成两半。

1）动词share 是“分享；分担；共同负担”的意思，如：share a room with someone
（与某人同住一个房间），share a book（合看一本书），share a taxi（同坐一辆出租车）等等。

2）  cut … in half 的意思是“把……切成两半；把……一切为二”。又如：
Please cut the orange in half. 请把橙子一切两半。

6.  So you’re halfway to solving a problem just by talking to someone about it! 因此，
你只要跟人聊聊这个问题，你就已经解决了问题的一半。

1）  be halfway to … 表示“完成了或做了事情的一部分”，其中 halfway 后面的 to 是

介词。再如：

We’re still only halfway to finishing the job. 我们才仅仅完成工作的一部分。

93

Notes on the TextNotes on the Text

2）句中的介词by 在此表示方式，相当于汉语“通过（⋯⋯办法）；（使）用（⋯⋯

方式）”的意思。又如：

We can practice and learn English by singing English songs. 我们可以通过唱英语歌曲

来学、练英语。

A: How do you study for a test? 你是如何复习备考的？
B: Well, most of the time by going over the notes and reading the textbook. 这个嘛，

大多数时候，是通过复习笔记和看课本。

Grammar

I.  不定代词 (Indefinite Pronouns)

不指明代替任何特定名词或形容词的代词叫做不定代词。常见不定代词如下所示：

some 一些
somebody 某人
someone 某人
something 某事；某物
any 一些；任何
anybody 任何人
anyone 任何人
anything 任何事物
no 无
nobody 无人
no one 无人

nothing 无物
all 全体；全部
both 两个（都）
none 没人或物（指两个以上）
neither 没人或物（指两个当中）
either 任何一个（指两个当中）
each 每个
every 每个
everybody 每人；大家；人人
everyone 每人
everything 每一件事物；一切

other(s) 另一个（些）
another 另外一个；又一个
much 很多
many 很多
few 很少
a few 一些；几个
little 很少
a little 一些
one  一个（人或物）

不定代词的用法中有几点需要注意，特别是有些不定代词兼具形容词的用法：

1.  some 和 any 既可代替或修饰可数名词复数，也可代替或修饰不可数名词。some 

多用于肯定句，any 则多用于否定句、疑问句和条件从句。例如：

A: Are there any apples in the fridge?
B: Yes, there are some./No, there aren’t any. 
A: Is there any water in the bottle?
B: Yes, there is some water./No, there isn’t any water. 
但是，在 Would you like some tea? 这类问句中则用 some，而不用 any，这是因为问

话者希望得到对方肯定的答复。

2.  many 和much 均表示“很多”。但many 只代替或修饰可数名词复数，而much 只

代替或修饰不可数名词。

3.  few 与a few 是一对反义词，代替或修饰可数名词复数；little 与a little 也是一对反
义词，代替或修饰不可数名词。few  和 little  的意思是“很少；几乎没有”，  侧重“否定”
的含义； a few 和a little 的意思是“有一些”，侧重“肯定”的含义。例如：

Don’t worry. There is a little time to go. 
We took quite a few photos there.
Few people know what happened.

112

There is now little hope of success.
4.  由 some，any，no，every  构成的复合不定代词作主语时，都作单数看待，其谓

语动词用单数第三人称形式。例如：

Grammar

Something is wrong with my watch. 
Well, everyone wants to win.
Nobody knows what the future will be like.
There is something for everyone at Greenwood Park.
5.  除no one 以外，其他复合不定代词都写成一个词。
6.  不定代词若有定语修饰，该定语要置于其后。例如：
Did anyone see something good at the cinema?
For lunch, we had something very special — Malaysian yellow noodles.
Do you have anything to say?

II.  频度副词 (Adverbs of Frequency)

频度副词表示事情发生的频率，可用来回答how often 引导的问句。常用的频度副词
有：always，almost always，usually，often，sometimes，hardly ever (seldom)，never 
等，它们在频度上的差异可以这样表示：

always (100%) > almost always > usually > often > sometimes > hardly ever 

(seldom) > never (0%)

频度副词通常放在动词前面，若句子里有情态动词、助动词或系动词 be，则放在这

类动词（第一个）的后面。例如：

It’s always interesting to watch other people show their talents.
Why do people usually make resolutions?
When we watch movies about the future, we sometimes see robots.
They hardly ever watch TV.
Fewer people will do such jobs in the future because they are boring, but robots will 

never get bored.

III.  形 容 词 和 副 词 的 比 较 级 和 最 高 级 (Comparative and Superlative Forms of 
Adjectives and Adverbs)

大多数形容词和副词有三个等级：1.  原级，即原形。 2.  比较级，表示“较⋯⋯”或

“更⋯⋯一些”。 3. 最高级，表示“最⋯⋯”。

不能单独使用，在句中一般不重读。冠词分不定冠词、定冠词和零冠词三类。

1.	 不定冠词	(Indefinite Articles)
a/an 是不定冠词，a 用在发音以辅音开头的单词之前，如 a book，a girl 等；an 则用
