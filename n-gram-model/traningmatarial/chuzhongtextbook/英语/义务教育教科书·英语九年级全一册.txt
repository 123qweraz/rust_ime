3a Read the passage about Wei Fen and answer the questions.

1.  Why did Wei Fen fi nd it diﬃ  cult to learn English?
2.  What did she do in English class?
3.  What is the secret to language learning?

How I Learned to Learn English
Last year, I did not like my English class. Every class was like a bad dream. Th  e teacher 
spoke so quickly that I did not understand her most of the time. I was afraid to ask 
questions because of my poor pronunciation. I just hid behind my textbook and 
never said anything.

Th  en one day I watched an English movie called Toy Story. I fell in love with this 
exciting and funny movie! So I began to watch other English movies, too. Although 
I could not understand everything the characters said, their body language and the 
expressions on their faces helped me to get the meaning. I also realized I could get 
the meaning by listening for just the key words. My pronunciation improved as 
well by listening to the conversations in English movies. I discovered that listening 
to something interesting is the secret to language learning. I also 
learned useful sentences like “It’s a piece of cake” or “It serves you 
right”. I did not understand these sentences at fi rst. But because I 
wanted to understand the story, I looked them up in a dictionary.

Now I really enjoy my English class. I want to learn new words 
and more grammar so that I can have a bett er understanding of 
English movies.

3b Complete the sentences with what Wei Fen learned from watching 

movies. Use words and phrases from the passage.

 and the

USING DICTIONARIES

How Can You Become 
a Successful Learner?
Everyone is born with the ability to learn. 
But whether or not you can do this well depends on your learning habits. Research 
But whether or not you can do this well depends on your learning habits. Research 
shows that successful learners have some good habits in common.

This can help you ﬁ nd the 
deﬁ nition that matches the 
context of the word in the text.

Creating an interest in what they learn
Studies show that if you are interested in something, your brain is more active 
and it is also easier for you to pay att ention to it for a long time. Good learners 
oft en connect what they need to learn with something interesting. For example, if 
they need to learn English and they like music or sports, they can listen to English 
songs or watch sports programs in English. Th  is way they will not get bored.

Practicing and learning from mistakes
Good learners think about what they are good at and what they need to practice more. 
Remember, “Use it or lose it.” Even if you learn something well, you will forget it 
unless you use it. “Practice makes perfect.” Good learners will keep practicing what 
they have learned, and they are not afraid of making mistakes. Alexander Graham Bell 
did not invent the telephone overnight. He succeeded by trying many times and learning 
from his mistakes.

Developing their study skills
It is not enough to just study hard. Good learners know the best way they can study. 
For example, they may take notes by writing down key words or by drawing mind 
maps. Th  ey also look for ways to review what they have learned. Th  ey may do this by 
reading their notes every day or by explaining the information to another student.

Asking questions
Good learners oft en ask questions during or aft er class. 
Th  ey even ask each other and try to fi nd out the answers. 
Knowledge comes from questioning.

Learning is a lifelong journey because every day brings 
something new. Everything that you learn becomes a 
part of you and changes you, so learn wisely and learn 
well.

Full Moon, Full Feelings

Chinese people have been celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival and enjoying  
mooncakes for centuries. Mooncakes are in the shape of a full moon on the  
Mid-Autumn night. They carry people’s wishes to the families they love and miss.
There are many traditional folk stories about this festival. However, most people 
think that the story of Chang’e is the most touching. Chang’e was Hou Yi’s beautiful 
wife.  After Hou Yi shot down the nine suns, a goddess gave him magic medicine to 
thank him. Whoever took this could live forever, and Hou Yi planned to take it with 
Chang’e. However, a bad man, Pang Meng, tried to steal the medicine when Hou 
Yi was not home. Chang’e refused to give it to him and took it all. She became very 
light and flew up to the moon. Hou Yi was so sad that he 
called out her name to the moon every night. One night, 
he found that the moon was so bright and round that he 
could see his wife there. He quickly laid out her favorite 
fruits and desserts in the garden. How he wished that 
Chang’e could come back!
After this, people started the tradition of admiring the 
moon and sharing mooncakes with their families.

A Christmas Carol

This means you have to 
“read between the lines” to 
get the meanings that are 
not clearly stated in a text.

Many would agree that when we think of 
Christmas, we probably think of gift s,  
Christmas trees and Santa Claus. But behind 
all these things lies the true meaning of  
Christmas: the importance of sharing and 
giving love and joy to people around us. Th  e story in A Christmas Carol
giving love and joy to people around us. Th  e story in A Christmas Carol is perhaps 
the best example of this.
A Christmas Carol is a famous short novel writt en by Charles Dickens. It is about an 
old man named Scrooge who never laughs or smiles. He is mean and only thinks 
about himself. He doesn’t treat others nicely. He just cares about whether he can make 
more money and he hates Christmas. One Christmas Eve, Scrooge sees the ghost of 
Jacob Marley, his dead business partner. Marley used to be just like Scrooge, so he was 
punished aft er he died. He warns Scrooge to change his ways if he doesn’t want to end 
up like him. He also tells Scrooge to expect three spirits to visit him.
Th  at night, three ghosts visit Scrooge. First, the Ghost of Christmas Past takes 
him back to his childhood and reminds Scrooge of his happier days as a child. 
Th  en the second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes him to see how 

others are spending Christmas this year. Everyone 
is happy, even poor people. Th  e last one, the Ghost 
of Christmas Yet to Come, takes him to the future. 
Scrooge sees that he is dead, but nobody cares. He is 
so scared that he wakes up in his bed and fi nds out it 
is only the next morning — Christmas Day!
He decides to change his life and promises to be a 
bett er person. He happily celebrates Christmas with 
his relatives. He also gives gift s to people in need. 
He now treats everyone with kindness and warmth, 
spreading love and joy everywhere he goes. And that 
is the true spirit of Christmas!

UNIT 3

2a Where do you need to make polite requests? Th  ink of some possible  

situations. Discuss them with your partner.

2b Read the article and underline the topic sentence for each paragraph.

USING SUITABLE LANGUAGE

In different situations, you 
need to choose and use  
suitable language based on 
cultural knowledge.

Could You Please ...?
When you visit a foreign country, it is 
important to know how to ask for help 
politely. For example, you may ask “Where 
are the restrooms?” or “Could you please tell me where the restrooms are?” Th  ese 
are similar requests for directions. Both are correct, but the fi rst one sounds less 
polite. Th  at is because it is a very direct question. It is not enough to just ask a 
question correctly. We also need to learn how to be polite when we ask for help.

Good speakers change the way they speak in diﬀ erent situations. Th  e expressions 
they use might depend on whom they are speaking to or how well they know 
each other. It is all right to ask your classmates direct questions because you know 
them well. However, if you say to your teacher, “When is the school trip?”, this 
might sound impolite. But if you say, “Excuse me, Mr. West. Do you know when 
the school trip is?”, this will sound much more polite.

Usually polite questions are longer. Th  ey include expressions such as “Could you 
please ...?” or “May I ask ...?” It sounds more polite to say, “Peter, could you please 
tell me your e-mail address?” than “Peter, tell me your e-mail address.” Sometimes 
we even need to spend time leading into a request. For example, we might fi rst say 
to a stranger, “Excuse me, I wonder if you can help me” or “I’m sorry to trouble you, 
but ...” before asking for help.

It might seem more diﬃ  cult to speak politely than directly. However, it is important 
to learn how to use the right language in diﬀ erent situations. Th  is will help you 
communicate bett er with other people.

Pardon me, could you
please tell me where to
park my car?

Where‛s the post ofﬁ ce?

Sure. There‛s an underground
parking lot over there.

Sorry. I can‛t help you.

 Candy’s background

From Shy Girl to Pop Star

1  For this month’s Young World magazine, I interviewed 19-year-old Asian pop 

star Candy Wang. Candy told me that she used to be really shy and took up singing 
to deal with her shyness. As she got better, she dared to sing in front of her class, 
and then for the whole school. Now she’s not shy anymore and loves singing in 
front of crowds.

2  I asked Candy how life was different after she became famous. She explained 

that there are many good things, like being able to travel and meet new people 
all the time. “I didn’t use to be popular in school, but now I get tons of attention 
everywhere I go.” However, too much attention can also be a bad thing. “I 
always have to worry about how I appear to others, and I have to be very careful 
about what I say or do. And I don’t have much private time anymore. Hanging 
out with friends is almost impossible for me now because 
there are always guards around me.”

3  What does Candy have to say to all those young people 
who want to become famous? “Well,” she begins slowly, 
“you have to be prepared to give up your normal life. You 
can never imagine how difficult the road to success is. 
Many times I thought about giving up, but I fought on. 
You really require a lot of talent and hard work to succeed. 
Only a very small number of people make it to the top.”

UNIT 53a Read the passage. What two things did Kang Jian want to buy in 

America? Where were they made?

The Difficult Search for 
American Products in the US

If you go to another country, what kinds of things would you buy? Would you buy 
a camera in Japan, some beautiful clothes in France, or a watch in Switzerland? No 
matter what you may buy, you might think those products were made in those 
countries. However, you could be wrong. Kang Jian is a 17-year-old student from 
Shanghai. Last year he went to visit his aunt and uncle in San Francisco. He found it 
interesting that so many products in the local shops were made in China. “I wanted 
to buy a toy car for my cousin, but even though most of the toys were American 
brands, they were made in China.”

Toys are not the only things made in China. “I wanted to buy a pair of basketball 
shoes,” he explains. “But I had to visit five or six stores before finding a pair made 
in America!” He realized that Americans can hardly avoid buying products made 
in China. “In fact,” he continues, “there were many other things there made in 
China — footballs, handbags, pet food, mobile phones. Even American flags are 
made in China!” Kang Jian thinks it’s great that China is so good at making these 
everyday things. However, he hopes that in the future China will also get better at 
making high-technology products that people can buy in all parts of the world.

3b Read the passage and answer the questions.

MOVING FROM GENERAL TO SPECIFIC

A general introduction of the topic is 
usually followed by speciﬁ c details and 
examples.

Beauty in Common Th  ings
Each diﬀ erent part of China has its 
own special forms of traditional art. 
Th  ese usually try to show the things that are important in life, such as love, beauty 
and family. Th  e most common things, from paper to clay to bamboo, are turned 
into objects of beauty.

According to Chinese history, sky lanterns were fi rst used by 
Zhuge Kongming. He sent them out to ask for help when in 
trouble. Today, sky lanterns are used at festivals and other 
celebrations. Th  ey are made of bamboo and covered with 
paper. When the lanterns are lit, they slowly rise into the air 
like small hot-air balloons for all to see. Th  ey are seen as bright 
symbols of happiness and good wishes.
Paper cutt ing has been around for over 

1,500 years. Paper cutt ing sounds very easy but it can be diﬃ  cult 
to do. Th  e paper, usually red, is folded before it is cut with scissors. 
Th  e most common pictures are fl owers, animals, and things 
about Chinese history. During the Spring Festival, they are put 
on windows, doors and walls as symbols of wishes for good 
luck and a happy new year.

Chinese clay art is famous because 
the clay pieces are so small but they look very real. Th  e 
pieces are usually cute children or lively characters from 
a Chinese fairy tale or historical story. Th  e pieces are 
carefully shaped by hand from a very special kind of clay 
and then allowed to air-dry. Aft er drying, they are fi red 

at a very high heat. Th  ey are then polished and painted. It takes several weeks to 
complete everything. Th  ese small pieces of clay art show the love that all Chinese 
people have for life and beauty.

Paragraph 3  How tea was invented by accident

An Accidental Invention

Did you know that tea, the most popular drink in the world (aft er water), was 
invented by accident? Many people believe that tea was fi rst drunk about 5,000 
years ago. It is said that a Chinese ruler called Shen Nong was the fi rst to discover 
tea as a drink. One day Shen Nong was boiling drinking water over an open fi re. 
Some leaves from a tea plant fell into the water and remained there for some time. 
It produced a nice smell so he tasted the brown water. It was quite delicious, and 
so, one of the world’s favorite drinks was invented.

A few thousand years later, Lu Yu, “the saint of tea”, 
mentioned Shen Nong in his book Cha Jing. Th  e book 
describes how tea plants were grown and used to make 
tea. It also discusses where the fi nest tea leaves were 
produced and what kinds of water were used.

It is believed that tea was brought to Korea and Japan 
during the 6th and 7th centuries. In England, tea didn’t 
appear until around 1660, but in less than 100 years, 
it had become the national drink. Th  e tea trade from 

China to Western countries took place in the 19th century. Th  is helped to spread 
the popularity of tea and the tea plant to more places around the world. Even 
though many people now know about tea culture, the Chinese are without doubt 
the ones who best understand the nature of tea.

Do You Know When Basketball
Was Invented?
Basketball is a much-loved and active sport 
that is enjoyed by many for fun and exercise. It is over 100 years old and is played by 
that is enjoyed by many for fun and exercise. It is over 100 years old and is played by 
more than 100 million people in over 200 countries. It is believed that the fi rst basketball 
game in history was played on December 21, 1891. Th  en in 1936 in Berlin, it became an 
event at the Olympics.

Basketball was invented by a Canadian doctor named James Naismith, who was 
born in 1861. When he was a college teacher, he was asked to think of a game that 
could be played in the winter. Dr. Naismith created a game to be played inside on 
a hard fl oor. Dr. Naismith divided the men in his class into two teams and taught 
them to play his new game. Players on the same team must work together to get the 
ball in the other team’s basket. At the same time, they need to stop the competing 
team from gett ing the ball into their own basket.

Today, the popularity of basketball has risen around the world, with many young 
people dreaming of becoming famous players. In China, you can sometimes see 
people playing basketball in parks, schools and

Mom Knows Best

When I was a tiny baby crying all night, my mom sang to me and stayed by my side.
When I was tired and hungry, she gave me food and warm arms to sleep in.
When I was two running through the fi eld, she made sure I was safe and kept me fr om 
danger.
When I fell and hurt myself, she gave me a hug and lift ed me up.

When I was seven coughing badly, she said no ice-cream for me.
But I talked back loudly, “I should be allowed to eat some! Give it to me now!”
When I was nine watching scary movies, she said it’d give me awful dreams.
But I shouted back angrily, “I should be allowed to watch it! I’m not a baby!”

When I was a teen going out with fr iends, she said, “Please be 
back by ten!”
But I talked back again — “I should not be told what to do! 
I’m seventeen now!”

Now I’m an adult, thinking back to those times.
I coughed for days aft er eating that ice-cream
And had scary dreams aft er watching that fi lm.
I was late for school fr om staying out past ten.
I regret talking back, not listening to Mom.
Mom knows best, and for me she wanted only the best!

Liu Yu, a fi ft een-year-old boy from Shandong, is 
a running star. He is on his school team and has 
always wanted to be a professional runner when 
he grows up. However, his parents won’t allow 
him to train so much. “Of course we want to 
see him achieve his dreams,” says Mr. Liu. “And 
we know how much he loves running. My wife 
and I have supported every one of his races. We 
have nothing against running! But we think our 
son needs to think about other possible jobs. He’s gett ing older now, so he needs 
to think about what will happen if he doesn’t end up as a professional runner.”
Liu Yu doesn’t really agree. “Well, I think I should be allowed to decide for myself,” 
he says. “My parents have always taught me how important it is to work hard at 
school and enter university. I understand this, but I’m serious about running. It’s 
the only thing I’ve ever wanted to do.”
His parents believe that Liu Yu should study hard in the evenings so they don’t 
allow him to practice running at night. “Maybe he thinks it’s too strict or unfair,” 
says Mrs. Liu. “But we think we’re doing the right thing. He needs to spend more 
time on his homework because it is diﬃ  cult to become a professional sports star.”
But Liu Yu still disagrees. “I know my parents care about me. Th  ey always talk 
about what will happen if I don’t succeed. But I will! I’m a quick runner! I think 
I should be allowed to make this choice myself. Only then will I have a chance to

C.  Animals in Our Neighborhood

We live in a small town and almost everyone knows each other. It used to be very 
quiet. Nothing much ever happened around here. However, these days, something 
unusual is happening in our town. Victor, a teacher at my school, is really nervous. 
When he was interviewed by the town newspaper, he said, “Every night we hear 
strange noises outside our window. My wife thinks that it could be an animal, but 
my friends and I think it must be teenagers having fun. My parents called the  
policemen, but they couldn’t fi nd anything strange. Th  ey think it might be the wind. 
I don’t think so!”

Victor’s next-door neighbor Helen is worried, too. “At fi rst, I thought that it might 
be a dog, but I couldn’t see a dog or anything else, either. So I guess it can’t be a 
dog. But then, what could it be?” One woman in the area saw something running 
away, but it was dark so she is not sure. “I think it was too big to be a dog,” she 
said. “Maybe it was a bear or a wolf.”

Everyone in our town is feeling uneasy, and everyone has 
his or her own ideas. Th  ere must be something visiting 
the homes in our neighborhood, but what is it? We have 
no idea. Most people hope that this animal or person will 
simply go away, but I do not think that is going to happen. 
Th  e noise-maker is having too much fun creating fear in the 
neighborhood.

Stonehenge — Can Anyone 
Explain Why It Is Th  ere?
Stonehenge, a rock circle, is not only one 
of Britain’s most famous historical places but also one of its greatest mysteries. 
Every year it receives more than 750,000 visitors. People like to go to this place 
especially in June as they want to see the sun rising on the longest day of the year.
For many years, historians believed Stonehenge was a temple where ancient leaders 
tried to communicate with the gods. However, historian Paul Stoker thinks this 
can’t be true because Stonehenge was built so many centuries ago. “Th  e leaders 
arrived in England much later,” he points out.
Another popular idea is that Stonehenge might be a kind of calendar. Th  e large 
stones were put together in a certain way. On midsummer’s morning, the sun 
shines directly into the center of the stones. Other people believe the stones have 
a medical purpose. Th  ey think the stones can prevent illness and keep people 
healthy. “As you walk there, you can feel the energy from your feet move up your 
body,” said one visitor. No one is sure what Stonehenge was used for, but most 
agree that the position of the stones must be for a special purpose. Some think it 
might be a burial place or a place to honor ancestors. Others think it was built to 
celebrate a victory over an enemy.
Stonehenge was built slowly over a long period of time. Most historians believe it 
must be almost 5,000 years old. One of the greatest mysteries is how it was built 
because the stones are so big and heavy. In 
2001, a group of English volunteers tried to 
build another Stonehenge, but they couldn’t. 
“We don’t really know who built Stonehenge,” 
says Paul Stoker. “And perhaps we might never 
know, but we do know they must have been 
hard-working — and great planners!”

What Do You Feel Like Watching Today?
While some people stick to only one kind of movie, I like to watch diﬀ erent 
kinds depending on how I feel that day.

When I’m down or tired, I prefer movies that can cheer me up. Comedies 
like Men in Black or cartoons like Kung Fu Panda have funny dialog and 
usually have a happy ending. Th  e characters may not be perfect, but they 
try their best to solve their problems. Aft er I watch them, my problems 
suddenly seem less serious and I feel much bett er again. Laughing for two 
hours is a good way to relax!

I don’t watch dramas or documentaries when I’m sad or tired. Dramas 
like Titanic make me feel even sadder. Documentaries like March of the 
Penguins which provide plenty of information about a certain subject can 
be interesting, but when I’m tired I don’t want to think too much. I don’t 
mind action movies like Spider-Man when I’m too tired to think. I can just 
shut oﬀ  my brain, sit back and enjoy watching an exciting superhero who 
always saves the world just in time.

Once in a while, I like to watch 
movies that are scary. Th  ey can be

them alone. I always bring a friend

NOTING SUPPORTING DETAILS

Supporting details can be examples, 
reasons, opinions or other detailed 
information in each paragraph.

Sad but Beautiful
Last night one of my Chinese friends 
took me to a concert of Chinese folk 
music. The piece which was played on the erhu especially moved me. The music was 
strangely beautiful, but under the beauty I sensed a strong sadness and pain. The 
piece had a simple name, Erquan Yingyue (Moon Reflected on Second Spring), but it 
was one of the most moving pieces of music that I’ve ever heard. The erhu sounded 
so sad that I almost cried along with it as I listened. Later I looked up the history of 
Erquan Yingyue, and I began to understand the sadness in the music.

The music was written by Abing, a folk musician who was born in the city of Wuxi 
in 1893. His mother died when he was very young. Abing’s father taught him to 
play many musical instruments, such as the drums, dizi and erhu, and by age 17, 
Abing was known for his musical ability. However, after his father died, Abing’s 
life grew worse. He was very poor. Not only that, he developed a serious illness 
and became blind. For several years, he had no home. He lived on the streets and 
played music to make money. Even after Abing got married and had a home again, 
he continued to sing and play on the streets. He performed in this way for many 
years.

Abing’s amazing musical skills made him very popular during his lifetime. By the 
end of his life, he could play over 600 pieces of music. Many of these were written 
by Abing himself. It is a pity that only six pieces of music in total were recorded for 
the future world to hear, but his popularity 
continues to this day. Today, Abing’s Erquan 
Yingyue is a piece which all the great erhu 
masters play and praise. It has become one 
of China’s national treasures. Its sad beauty 
not only paints a picture of Abing’s own life 
but also makes people recall their deepest 
wounds from their own sad or painful  
experiences.

Teresa Lopez
Cali, Colombia

Where I’m from, we’re 
prett  y relaxed about 
time. We don’t like to 
rush around, so we 
don’t mind if people are a litt le late 
sometimes. If you tell a friend you’re 
going to their house for dinner, it’s OK 
if you arrive a bit late. We like to enjoy 
our time slowly. We value the time we 
spend with our family and friends in 
our everyday lives. We oft en just drop 
by our friends’ homes if we have time. 
We don’t usually have to make plans 
to meet our friends. When we see 
each other, it’s polite for boys to shake 
hands and for girls to kiss each other 
on the side of the face. We oft en just 
walk around the town center, seeing as 
many of our friends as we can!

Marc LeBlanc
Lausanne, Switzerland

In Switzerland, 
it’s very important 
to be on time. 
We’re the capital 

of clocks and watches, aft er all! If 
someone invites you to meet him or 
her at noon, then you’re expected to be 
there at noon. If you’re even 15 minutes 
late, your friend may get mad. So I make 
an eﬀ ort to be on time when I meet my 
friends. I always leave the house early 
to avoid heavy traﬃ  c because I think it’s 
impolite to keep others waiting. Also, 
we never visit a friend’s house without

REVIEWING

Dear Laura,

Taking notes or summarizing the main 
ideas can help you move language from 
your short-term to long-term memory.

Th  anks for your message. Yes, I’m 
having a great time on my student 
exchange program in France. I was a bit nervous before I arrived here, but there was 
no reason to be. My host family is really nice. Th  ey go out of their way to make me 
feel at home. Th  e grandmother knows that I miss Chinese food a lot. So she actually 
learned how to make Chinese food! She also has a teenage granddaughter about 
my age who is really kind. She always talks to me in French to help me practice. You 
wouldn’t believe how quickly my French has improved because of that. I’m very 
comfortable speaking French now. Although I still make lots of mistakes, it doesn’t 
worry me as it used to.
My biggest challenge is learning how to behave at the dinner table. As you can imagine, 
things are very diﬀ erent from the way they are at home. For example, you’re not 
supposed to put your bread on your plate. You’re supposed to put it on the table! I 
thought that was prett y strange at fi rst, but now I’m used to it. Another example is 
that you’re not supposed to eat anything with your hands except bread, not even 
fruit. You have to cut it up and eat it with a fork. Another thing is that it is impolite 
to say you’re full. If you don’t want any more food, you should just say, “Th  at was 
delicious.” Also, you’re not supposed to put your elbows on the table. I have to say 
that I fi nd it diﬃ  cult to remember everything, but I’m gradually gett ing used to it. I 
don’t fi nd French customs so strange anymore.
I’ll write again soon and tell you more about 
my life in France. Hope you’re having a good 
school year.

Yours,
Lin Yue

Th  e Shirt of a Happy Man (Part I)

A long time ago, in a rich and beautiful country, 
there lived an unhappy king. He slept badly and 
didn’t feel like eating. His face was always pale as 
chalk. He oft en cried for no reason. Th  is made 
the queen and his people worried.

Why or why not?

2. Why does power not make the 

prime minister happy?

3. Why does money not make the 

banker happy?

4. Why does fame not make the 

singer happy?

One day, a doctor was called in to examine the king. But he found nothing wrong 
with his body. “It’s all in his mind. Neither medicine nor rest can help him. What 
he needs is the shirt of a happy person to wear. Th  at’ll make him happy.”

Th  e prime minister was called to the palace. But when they explained the king’s 
situation to him, he said, “Although I have a lot of power, it doesn’t make me 
happy. I’m always worried about losing my power. Many people are trying to 
take my position.”

Th  en, the king’s banker came to the palace. “Oh, I’m afraid I’m not happy either,” 
he said. “I have a lot of wealth, but I’m always worried about 
losing my money. Someone tries to steal my money every day.”

Next, the palace singer came to the king’s room. But this was 
what he said: “It’s true that I’m famous and everyone loves my 
songs. But I’m not happy because I’m always worried about 
being followed by others. I cannot be free!”

Finally, the king’s top general was told to go out and fi nd a 
happy man in three days’ time.

Knowing the meanings of idioms

English.

Th  e Winning Team
Peter kept his eyes on the ground. He 
felt like there was a heavy weight on his 
shoulders as he walked home alone. It 
was the worst day of his life. His mind would not stop thinking about what happened 
only just an hour ago on the school soccer fi eld. How could he have missed scoring 
that goal? He had let his whole team down. His stupid mistake made him angry. His 
team had lost the game because of him. He was really worried that his coach might 
kick him oﬀ  the team.
As soon as he walked through the door, his father asked, “What’s wrong, son?” 
Peter’s feelings were writt en all over his face. “I lost the game,” Peter replied. Th  en 
he went into his room without another word. Ten minutes later, Peter heard his 
father knocking on his bedroom door. He opened the door to let him in.
“Look, Peter. I don’t know what happened. But whatever it was, don’t be too hard 
on yourself.”
“I lost the game, Dad. I failed my team. Th  ey’ll probably never let me play again.”
“Soccer is about team eﬀ ort. You’re not the only reason your team lost. If you have 
a good team, you should support each other. Besides, winning or losing is only half 
the game. Th  e other half is learning how to communicate with your teammates and 
learning from your mistakes.”
Peter didn’t say anything, but what his father said made him think carefully.
Th  e next day, Peter went to soccer practice with courage rather than fear in his heart.
“Hey, guys,” he said to his teammates. “I’m really sorry about yesterday. We were 
so close to winning that game. But I think if we continue to pull together, we’re 
going to win the next one.”
To his surprise and relief, his teammates all 
nodded in agreement.
“Yeah,” they said, “don’t worry about it. It’s 
never just one person’s fault. We should think 
about how we can do bett er next time.”
Peter smiled. It made him feel lucky to know 
that he was on a winning team.

In May 2001, I found a job in New

September 11, 2001, I arrived at my building 
at around 8:30 a.m. I was about to go up

the others outside to see what was going 
on, the fi rst plane had already hit my oﬃ  ce building. We stared in disbelief at the 
black smoke rising above the burning building. I felt lucky to be alive.

Almost 10 years later, I woke up at 10:00 a.m. on February 21, 2011 and realized 
that my alarm had never gone oﬀ . I jumped out of bed and went straight to the 
airport. But by the time I got to the airport, my plane to New Zealand had already

Examples of funny stories that happened on April Fool’s Day

April Fool’s Day is a celebration that takes 
place in diﬀ erent countries around the 
world. It happens on April 1st every year 
and is a day when many people play all 
kinds of tricks and jokes on each other.

USING BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE

Carefully reading the ﬁ rst sentence 
in each paragraph can activate your 
own knowledge of the topic and 
help you guess what the whole text 
is about.

One April Fool’s Day, a reporter in England 
announced that there would be no more spaghett i because the spaghett i farmers in 
announced that there would be no more spaghett i because the spaghett i farmers in 
Italy had stopped growing spaghett i. Many people ran to their local supermarkets to 
buy as much spaghett i as they could. By the time people realized that the story was a 
hoax, all of the spaghett i across the country had been sold out. In another famous trick 
a TV show in England reported the discovery of special water. Th  ey said this water 
would help people lose weight and that one customer had already lost a lot of weight 
in just four months. By the end of the day, more than 10,000 people had phoned the 
TV station to fi nd out how to get this water.

Many April Fool’s jokes may end up being not very funny. A famous TV star once 
invited his girlfriend onto his show on April Fool’s Day. He asked her to marry him. 
Th  e lady was so happy because she really wanted to get married. However, when she 
said yes, he replied, “April Fool!” Th  at litt le joke didn’t have a very happy ending. 
Th  e TV star lost his girlfriend and his show was canceled.

One of the world’s most famous tricks, however, happened in October rather than in 
April. In that month in 1938, actor Orson Welles announced on his radio program 
that aliens from Mars had landed on the earth. He 
described where they had landed and told how 
they were moving across the United States. Welles 
made it sound so real that hundreds of people  
believed the story, and fear spread across the 
whole country. By the time police oﬃ  cers  
announced that the story was a hoax, thousands 
of people had left  their homes.

3a Read the passage about sharks and complete the fact sheet below.

Save the Sharks!
Many have heard of shark fin soup. But do you 
realize that you’re killing a whole shark each 
time you enjoy a bowl of shark fin soup?

When people catch sharks, they cut off their 
fins and throw the sharks back into the ocean. 
This is not only cruel, but also harmful to the 
environment. Without a fin, a shark can no longer swim and slowly dies. Sharks 
are at the top of the food chain in the ocean’s ecosystem. If their numbers drop 
too low, it will bring danger to all ocean life. Many believe that sharks can never be 
endangered because they are the strongest in their food chain. But in fact, around 
70 million sharks are caught and traded in this industry every year. The numbers of 
some kinds of sharks have fallen by over 90 percent in the last 20 to 30 years.

Environmental protection groups around the world, such as WildAid and the 
WWF, are teaching the public about “finning”. They have even asked governments 
to develop laws to stop the sale of shark fins. So far, no scientific studies have shown 
that shark fins are good for health, so why eat them? Help save the sharks!

Rethink, Reuse, Recycle!
Do you oft en throw away things you 
don’t need anymore? Have you ever 
thought about how these things can 
actually be put to good use? Nothing is a 
waste if you have a creative mind.

may change the meanings of words 
and how they are used.

You have probably never heard of Amy Hayes, but 
she is a most unusual woman. She lives in a house 
in the UK that she built herself out of rubbish. 
Th  e windows and doors come from old buildings 
around her town that were pulled down. Th  e top 
of the house is an old boat turned upside down. 
And the gate in front of her house is made of 
rocks and old glass bott les. Amy recently won a 

prize from the Help Save Our Planet Society. Th  e president said, “Amy is an  
inspiration to us all.”
Amy isn’t the only one who is good at recycling. 
Jessica Wong from Hong Kong uses old clothes that 
people don’t wear anymore to make bags. She has 
been doing this for a few years now. She opened a 
small shop where she sells her bags, and she has also 
set up a website to sell them online. She especially 
likes to use old jeans to make handbags. Her bags are 
cute and useful. “I plan to write a book about new 
ways to use old clothes,” she said. “I hope people can read my book and enjoy it!”
Wang Tao set up a small business in Shanghai four years ago. He is known for using 

iron and other materials from old cars to make beautiful art pieces. 
Some are large pieces that look like animals or humans, and 

some are smaller pieces you can put at home. Th  e more popular 
works can even be seen in art shops around the city. Wang Tao 
hopes to set up a “metal art” theme park to show people the 
importance of environmental protection. Not only can the art 
bring happiness to others, but it also shows that even cold, hard 

iron can be brought back to life with a litt le creativity.

Trying to be on time for morning readings
Running when the lunch bell rings

Of the school sports day each year
The many long hours of training
Pride of overcoming fear

I remember starting day one
The shyest in my whole class
Never speaking to anyone
And thinking I would not pass

Then slowly I made some new friends
To remember forever
Helping each other with homework
Getting better together

Preparing for art festivals
And making a great big mess
Having fun at New Year’s parties
Wishing everyone the best

We have learned a different language
That is from a foreign land
English brings many challenges
We work hard to understand

And now it’s time to graduate
We will leave our lovely school
I can’t believe it’s been three years
I’m trying to keep my cool

But it’s difficult not to cry
I’ll miss the school trees and flowers
And our kind and caring teachers
Wonderful memories of ours

Ladies and gentlemen, 

Quickly read through a text to see what 
kind of writing it is, who wrote it and 
why it was written.

Th  ank you for coming today to 
att end the graduation ceremony at 
No. 3 Junior High School. First of all, I’d like to congratulate all the students who 
are here today. I remember meeting all of you when you were just starting Grade 
7 at this school. You were all so full of energy and thirsty for knowledge. And yes, 
some of you were a litt le diﬃ  cult to deal with! But today I see a room full of talented 
young adults who are full of hope for the future. You’ve all grown up so much and I’m 
so proud of you.

Although you’ve all worked very hard over the last three 
years, none of you did it alone. I hope you’ll remember the 
important people in your lives who helped and supported 
you — your parents, your teachers and your friends. 
Please consider what they’ve done for you and what 
they mean to you. Never fail to be thankful to the people 
around you.

Lastly, the end of junior high school is the beginning of 
a new life. I don’t need to tell you that life in senior high 
school will be harder and that you have many diﬃ  cult 
tasks ahead of you. You’ll make mistakes along the way, 

but the key is to learn from your mistakes and never give up. But along with  
diﬃ  culties, there will also be many exciting things waiting for you. Behind each 
door you open are chances to learn new things, and you have the ability to make 
your own choices. Choose wisely and be responsible for your decisions and  
actions. Although you have to go your separate ways now, I hope that in a few years’ 
time, you’ll come back to visit our school. As you set out on your new journey, you 
shouldn’t forget where you came from. Th  e future is yours.

Good luck and hope to see you again sometime soon!

1.  Don’t read word by word. Read word groups. 不要一个字一个字地读，要按意群读。
1)	 此句中介词 by 表示连续或反复，意为“（一个）接着（一个）；（一个）又（一

个）”。例如：

one by one	 一个接一个	
year by year	 年复一年	
They went out of the classroom one by one.	他们一个接着一个走出了教室。
2)  word group 表示“词组；意群”，指语言使用中表达意思相对完整的一组词语。
在口语中，说话者应将其连贯说出，表达一个完整的意思。在阅读时，也应按意群读，以

little by little	 一点一点	
step by step	 一步一步	

便更好地理解文章意思，加快阅读速度。

2.  It takes time. 这得慢慢来。 

动词 take 可用来表示“花费；消耗”时间。但在 It takes time. 和 Please take your 

time. 这样的句子中，它们所表达的意思是“不着急；慢慢来”。例如：

You can take your time.	你慢慢来。
A: These dresses are really nice and I can’t decide which one to buy.	这几条裙子都很

漂亮，我不知道该买哪一条。

B: Well, try them on and see how they look on you. Take your time. There’s no hurry.	

嗯，把它们都试试，看看穿上怎么样。你慢慢来，不着急。

3.  I also learned useful sentences like “It’s a piece of cake” or “It serves you right”. 
我还学会了像“这简直是小菜一碟”和“你活该”这样的有用的句子。

a piece of cake 和 serve somebody right 是英语中的两个习惯用语，也可称作习语
(idiom)。同汉语中的成语类似，习语是人们在长期的语言运用中确定或形成的一种固定
表达方式，其意思往往不是字面所表达的含义。如：a piece of cake  表示事情非常简单、
易于解决，相当于汉语的“小菜一碟；小事一桩”；serve somebody right 则相当于汉语说
某人“活该”。再如：

It’s a piece of cake to you, but for me it’s quite different.	那对你来说是小菜一碟，但对

我而言却完全不同。

A: Tommy came late again and was punished by Mr. Morton.	汤米又迟到了，被莫顿

老师罚了。

B: Serves him right. I told him yesterday to arrive early.	他活该，我昨天还告诉他要早

到呢。	

4.  I can’t pronounce some of the words. 有些单词我不会读。

I can’t spell some English words. 有些英语单词我拼不出来。
以上两个否定句中，只能用 some 而不用 any，因为 some 表示其中“一些”（单词），
并非“全部”单词；若用any，那么I can’t pronounce/spell any of the words. 则表示“所
有的单词都不会读（拼写）”。any 强调的是“任何的；所有的”。some 和	any 的运用要看
具体的语境和句子所要表达的意义，而不是简单认为否定句和疑问句中不可使用 some。
在疑问句中，特别是在表示请求、建议和反问时，也往往使用some，因为some 在这些语
句中体现的是说话者肯定的含义。例如：

Can I have some of your cake?	我可以吃些你的蛋糕吗？	
Shall we try some local food?	我们尝试一下当地的食物如何？	
Why can’t we just build some more parks?	为什么我们就不能修建更多的公园呢？	
5.  But whether or not you can do this well depends on your learning habits. 但是你
能否做好取决于你的学习习惯。

1)	 此句中whether or not you can do this well 是一个从句，用作整个句子的主语。这

种从句叫作“主语从句”。又如：

Whether you did it right or wrong isn’t so important. What’s important is the experience 

you gained.	你做对做错都不重要，重要的是你从中获得了经验。

2)  whether or not 是英语从句的一个连词结构，意思和功能均相当于 whether，表示
“是否”，常出现在宾语从句、主语从句中。使用时，也可把 whether 和 or not 分开，or 
not	放到句尾。例如：

I can’t tell whether or not the teacher likes me.	我不知道老师喜不喜欢我。
此句也可以写成：I can’t tell whether the teacher likes me or not.	

6.  Alexander Graham Bell 亚历山大·格雷厄姆·贝尔

亚历山大·格雷厄姆·贝尔（1847 － 1922）是出生于苏格兰的美国电气工程学家、

发明家、企业家和聋哑教育家。贝尔以发明电话闻名于世。他在 1876 年申请并获得电话

专利权时仅 29 岁。贝尔电话公司（AT&T 公司的前身）于 1877 年成立。贝尔一生致力于
科技发明和聋哑人教育领域，他还为创办美国“国家地理学会”（National Geographic 
Society）和科普期刊《科学》（Science）杂志做出了贡献。
7.  Knowledge comes from questioning. 知识源于质疑。

question	作动词，放在介词from 后面要用它的-ing 形式，在本句中是“质疑；质问”

的意思。例如：

I just accepted what he told me. I never thought to question it.	我只是相信了他告诉

114

 
我的话，从来没有质疑过。

People would question whether we are telling them the truth. 人们会质问我们是否向

他们说了实话。

question 用作动词还有“提问；讯问；审问”的意思。例如：
The police questioned him for three hours before letting him go. 警察询问了他三个

小时方让他离开。

I think that mooncakes are delicious!

Unit 2 
1.  People go on the streets to throw water at each other. 人们走上街头互相泼水。

本句中throw ... at ... 意为“抛向；泼向；洒向”，动词throw 后接所投掷的物体，用

介词 at 引入泼洒或抛的对象。又如：

On our way here, someone threw a stone at our car, but fortunately we were not hit. 

在我们来的路上，有人向我们的车投掷石块，所幸的是我们没被砸中。

It’s the first snow of the year, and the children are happily throwing snowballs at each 

other. 这是今年的第一场雪，孩子们高兴地互相扔雪球。
2.  Charles Dickens and his novel A Christmas Carol 查尔斯·狄更斯和他的小说《圣
诞欢歌》

Charles Dickens（1812 － 1870）查尔斯·狄更斯是英国最受欢迎的作家之一。他的
代表作有《圣诞欢歌》《双城记》《远大前程》《大卫·科波菲尔》《艰难时世》《匹克威克

外传》和《奥列佛·特维斯特》（又译为《雾都孤儿》）等。这些作品是世界文学宝库中的

瑰宝，时至今日仍脍炙人口。除了作家之外，狄更斯还是著名的朗诵者、编辑、主编，并

且他还总是乐于为各种慈善事业奔忙。

A Christmas Carol《圣诞欢歌》创作于 1843 年，是狄更斯以圣诞题材创作的一部著名
小说。作品讲述了一个名叫斯克鲁奇（Scrooge）的商人，他为人吝啬、待人刻薄。三个
幽灵在圣诞前夜登门造访了他，让他看到了自己的过去、现在和未来。翌日，斯克鲁奇洗

心革面，痛改前非，转变成为一个慷慨大方、富有爱心的人。这部作品奠定了现代圣诞节

的寓意和内涵，同时也告诫人们要拥有一颗善良、仁慈、怜悯、包容之心。善良仁慈、乐

善好施才是幸福的源泉。

狄更斯这部作品对英语世界的影响深远，当代英语语汇中 Scrooge（或scrooge）已成
为一个普通名词，意为“吝啬鬼”。这一语义就是源自《圣诞欢歌》中斯克鲁奇这一人物

形象。

3.  He also tells Scrooge to expect three spirits to visit him. 他还让斯克鲁奇等待三个
幽灵的造访。

  And that is the true spirit of Christmas. 这就是圣诞节真正的意义。

115

Page PB

Notes on the Text以上两个例子中的名词 spirit 的意思完全不一样：第一个句子中 spirit 是“灵魂；鬼

怪；幽灵”之意；第二个句子中spirit 指与肉体相对而言的“精神；心灵”。试比较：

I shall be with you in spirit. 我在精神上与你们同在。
In the story, it is said that the area is haunted by evil spirits. 在故事里，据说那片地区

闹鬼。

4.  He is mean and only thinks about himself. He doesn’t treat others nicely. 他十分
吝啬，只想着自己。他对待其他人也不友善。

mean 在句中作形容词，意思是“吝啬的；小气的”。例如：
Mr. Smith is a mean old man. 史密斯先生是一个小气的老头。
He was mean to those who worked for him. 他对那些为他工作的人刻薄小气。
Some people around us are mean with money. 我们周围有些人在金钱方面十分吝啬。

Unit 3  Could you please tell me where the restrooms are?
1.  I’m excited to try the rides! 要尝试些乘骑项目，我好兴奋呀！

英语名词 ride 有多种用法和意思。涉及游乐园主题时，往往笼统地指园中各种各样
“供玩乐的乘骑装置”，如：旋转木马、疯狂老鼠、过山车等。其具体的汉语译文要视情境

而定。例如：

a roller coaster ride 坐过山车
How about that new ride over there? 去玩玩那个新开的乘骑项目怎样？
My favorite ride is the Ferris Wheel. 我最喜欢的乘骑项目是“大转轮”。
The rides are free today. 今天这些乘骑项目免费。

2.  Alice: ... could you first tell me where the restrooms are? 艾丽斯：……你能先告诉
我哪儿有洗手间吗？

  He Wei: Pardon? Restroom? You want to rest? 何伟：什么？休息室？你想要休
息吗？

上面对话中何伟误解了艾丽斯，认为 restroom 是休息室，但实际上，restroom 在
此处指的是“厕所；洗手间”。英语中常见的表达“厕所；洗手间”的词还有：toilet，
washroom，bathroom 等。
3.  I was scared at first, but shouting did help. 起初我好害怕，但大声喊还很管用。

此句相当于 I was scared at first, but shouting really helped. 原句是一种表示强调的句

式，英语中，可用助动词do 对谓语动词进行强调，构成强调句。例如：

Please do be careful. 请一定小心呦。
I do agree with you. 我完全同意你的意见。
He did warn you the other day, remember? 他前两天就告诫过你，还记得吗？

116

Notes on the Text4.  Both are correct, but the first one sounds less polite. 两种说法都正确，但是第一个
听起来没那么礼貌。

“less + 形容词或副词”构成降级比较形式，相当于汉语“不那么；稍许不……”之

意。例如：

His second movie is less interesting, I think. 我认为他的第二部影片就不那么有趣。
less 后面常常接than，引入比较的对象。例如：
Some kinds of dogs are less friendly than others. 有些品种的狗不如其他品种那么友善。
5.  It might seem more difficult to speak politely than directly. 看起来说得客气要比说
得直白更难一点。

1)  句中 it 虽然是主语，但并没有意义。句子的真正主语是动词不定式短语 to speak 
politely。it 是“形式主语”，代替真实主语，放在句首，以免使句子有头重脚轻之感。
又如：

It is very helpful to be able to speak a foreign language. 能说一门外语是非常有用的。
It took me three days to finish the project. 完成这个项目花了我三天时间。
2)  情态动词 might 表达一种可能性及推测的不确定性，意思与表达可能性的 may 相

当，表示“有可能；也许会”，但语气却更加委婉、含蓄，更不确定。例如：

The train might be a few hours late. 火车也许会晚点几个小时。
Gina might not be able to go. 吉娜可能去不了。

6.  There’s an underground parking lot over there. 那边有一个地下停车场。

parking lot 意为“停车场”，属美语用法，其中lot 为“土地”的意思。在英国，人们

将停车场称作car park。

I used to be afraid of the dark.

Unit 4 
1.  I get tons of attention everywhere I go. 无论我到哪里，总是被人关注。

get tons of attention 在句中表示“被众人所关注；吸引无数目光”之意。其中tons of 
something 是一种非正式的表达法，相当于lots of something，但带有一定夸张和感情色
彩，表示“很多；极多”，具体翻译用词要根据上下文语境而定。再如：

They have tons of work to do every day. 他们每天有大量的工作要做。
The sports stars in America can make tons of money. 美国的体育明星能挣非常多的钱。
2.  Hanging out with friends is almost impossible for me now because there are 
always guards around me. 现在与朋友们外出对我来说几乎不再可能，因为老有保安守
在我的周围。

hanging out with friends 在本句中是动词-ing 形式作主语。又如：
Working together with them helped me know much more about their life. 与他们一

117

Notes on the Text同劳动帮我更好地了解了他们的生活。

Walking in the park is one of my favorite activities. 在公园散步是我最喜欢的活动之一。
3.  Many times I thought about giving up, but I fought on. 许多次我都想放弃，但我奋
力坚持了下来。

本句中的 fight 为“努力去做；尽力尝试”之意，副词 on 表示“继续（地）；持续

（地）”。因此，fight on 表示“奋力坚持下去”的意思。例如：

We must fight on until the end of the battle. 我们必须坚持到战斗结束。

4.  She advised them to talk with their son in person. 她建议他们亲自与自己的儿子
谈谈。

in person 为介词短语，表示“亲自；亲身”。例如：
I called him but he didn’t answer. So I decided to talk to him in person. 我给他打电

话，但他没接，所以我决定亲自去跟他谈谈。

You have to sign for it in person. 你必须亲自签收。

Unit 5  What are the shirts made of?
1.  Where is tea produced in China? 中国哪里产茶？

英语中produce，grow 和plant 三个动词均可用来描述农作物及植物的“种植；生产；
生长”，但有所区别。produce 指农作物成产量化地“出产”，或自然地“生长出；长出；
结出（果实）”。例如：

This region produces over 50% of the country’s rice. 这个地区出产整个国家50% 以上

的大米。

These trees can produce very good apples. 这些树能结出优质的苹果。
grow 表示“种植；使生长”，着重指种植以后的栽培、生长过程。例如：
These plants grow from seeds. 这些植物从种子生长而来。
The villagers grow coffee and corn to sell in the market. 村民们种植咖啡和玉米好拿

到市场上去卖。

plant 侧重“栽种；播种”这一行为，指把种子或秧苗栽种到土壤里使之生长。例如：
How many trees have you planted this year? 今年你们种了多少棵树？
They planted tomatoes and carrots in their backyard. 他们在后院栽种了西红柿和胡

萝卜。

2.  He realized that Americans can hardly avoid buying products made in China. 他
意识到美国人几乎无法避免购买中国制造的产品。

动词 avoid 的意思是“回避；逃避；躲避”，其后可接名词、代词及动词 -ing 形式等

作宾语，但不可接动词不定式。例如：

118

Notes on the TextI can see she’s trying hard to avoid meeting my eyes. 我看得出来她极力回避我的目光。
avoid 另有“避免；阻止发生（不好的事情）”的意思。例如：
Young children are taught road safety to avoid road accidents. 对孩子们进行道路安全

教育以避免交通事故的发生。

It’s not a bad idea to keep quiet to avoid a quarrel. 保持沉默以避免吵架不是个坏主意。
3.  Kang Jian thinks it’s great that China is so good at making these everyday things. 
康健认为中国擅长制造这些日常商品是很了不起的。

everyday 是 every 和 day 构成的一个合成词，意为“每日的；每天的；日常的；平日

的”。everyday 是形容词，仅用在名词之前作定语，不能单独使用。例如：

everyday life  日常生活 
everyday activities  日常活动 
注意：everyday  与 every day 有区别，every day 是副词短语，意为“每天”，相当于

everyday English  日常英语 
everyday clothes  平日里穿的服装 

each day，通常用作句子的时间状语。例如：

We see each other every day. 我们俩每天见面。
The teacher asked us to read English books every day. 老师让我们每天都要读英语书。
4.  The most common things, from paper to clay to bamboo, are turned into objects 
of beauty. 最为普通的东西，从纸张到陶土再到竹子，都变成了精美的物品。

1)  turn ... into ... 表示“把……变成…… ；使……变成……”，而 turn into 表示

“转变；变成”等意思。例如：

Can you turn an egg into a flower? 你能把鸡蛋变成花朵吗？
In recent years, spring has quickly turned into hot summer in our area. 近年来，在我

们这个地区，春天很快就变成了炎热的夏天。

The sunny morning turned into a rainy day. 晴朗的早晨变成了雨天。
2)  objects of beauty 在此为“精美之物；精美物品”的意思。其中object 指具体、实

际的“物品；东西”。例如：

an everyday object such as a spoon 诸如勺子这样的日常物品 
Look, there’s a strange object in the sky! 快瞧，天上有一个奇怪的东西！

5.  The pieces are carefully shaped by hand from a very special kind of clay and then 
allowed to air-dry. 这些作品通过手工用一种特殊的陶土精心塑型，然后再自然晾干。

1)  此句中名词piece 意为“作品”，指由艺人、作家等创作出来的艺术品或文学作品。

例如：

Just take a look at this lovely clay piece. Doesn’t this boy look real! 看看这个可爱的小

陶人，这男孩看上去多么逼真啊！

Did you read that piece in today’s newspaper? 你看过今天报纸上的那篇文章了吗？

119

Notes on the Text 
Liszt wrote lots of piano pieces. 李斯特写了许多钢琴曲。
2)  air-dry 是由 air 和 dry 复合而成的一个合成动词，意为“晾干”，类似的词还有

blow-dry 吹干。

Unit 6  When was it invented?
1.  Well, you do seem to have a point ... 嗯，看来你说的确实有点道理……

这句话中的助动词do 放在动词seem 前面主要用来加强语气，通常可译作“的确；确
实”。在谓语动词前添加助动词do 表示强调的用法常见于肯定句和祈使句中，类似的例子
在本册第三单元中已出现。又如：

I do hope you can come to my party. 我真的希望你能来参加我的聚会。
在英语中，have a point 通常指某人的说法或想法“有道理”。如：
Perhaps you have a point there, but the problem is that we don’t have a choice. 也许

你说的有道理，但问题是我们没有选择。

2.  It is said that a Chinese ruler called Shen Nong was the first to discover tea as a 
drink. 据说有一位叫作神农的中国统治者最早发现了茶可以饮用。

It is said that ... 是一个常见句式，表示“据说……”， that 后面接完整的句子。又如：
It is said that thirteen is an unlucky number in many Western countries. 据说在许多

西方国家，13 是个不吉利的数字。

本单元还有一个类似的句式：It is believed that ..., 意思是“人们认为……”，其后同

样接完整的句子。例如：

It is believed that tea was brought to Korea and Japan during the 6th and 7th 

centuries. 人们认为，茶在六至七世纪传到了朝鲜和日本。
3.  Cha Jing  《茶经》

《茶经》是我国唐代一部有关茶叶及品茶的专著，作者陆羽。该书共分三卷十节，全

面叙述了茶叶生产的历史、源流、生产技术以及饮茶技艺和茶道原理，享有“茶叶百科全

书”之美誉。

4.  In 1875, Mr. Bell learned how to send musical notes through an instrument 
similar to a telephone. 1875 年，贝尔先生学会用一种类似电话的器械发送乐符。

musical note 意为“乐符”。作为术语，在音乐主题下常简写作 note。如：high notes

为“高音符”，low notes 为“低音符”。
5.  Today, the popularity of basketball has risen around the world, with many young 
people dreaming of becoming famous players. 如今，许多年轻人都梦想成为著名的篮
球运动员，篮球在世界各地也越来越普及。

1)  此处 today 用作副词，修饰整个句子，并非指具体的“今天；今日”，而是表示当

120

Notes on the Text前的一段时间，相当于汉语“如今；当今”的意思，这与汉语“今天”一词的使用十分相

似。再如：

Today, only a few kinds of these beautiful animals still live on the earth. 现今，这些美

丽的动物只有少数几种还生活在地球上。

It seems to me that kids today depend more on their parents. 在我看来，如今的孩子

更加依赖他们的父母。

2)  本句中，介词with与在意义上有主谓关系的复合结构many young people dreaming 

of ...构成短语，用作状语。
6.  The number of foreign players, including Chinese players, in the NBA has 
increased. NBA 中的外国球员数量有所增加，其中也包括中国球员。

1)  此句主语的核心名词是 number，表示“数量”，由于是单数形式，谓语动词需要
与之相匹配，故为 has increased。语法上，人们将这种主语和谓语在数上的匹配称作“主
谓一致”。当主语为复数概念时，谓语动词用复数形式与之匹配；当主语为单数概念时，

谓语动词则用单数形式。例如：

People there are very friendly. 那里的人们十分友善。（people 为复数概念）
The United Nations is an international organization that tries to find peaceful 
solutions to world problems. 联合国是一个尝试寻求和平解决世界问题的国际组织。（the 
United Nations 是一个组织，为单数概念）

2)  短 语 the number of ... 意 为“ …… 的 数 量；…… 的 数 目 ”， 如：the number of 
students in the class（班级人数），the number of animals（动物的数量）。The number 
of ... 用作主语时，其谓语动词应用单数形式。英语另有 a number of ... 短语，表示“若
干的；一些”，用来修饰可数名词，如：a number of students（一些学生），a number of 
mistakes（一些错误）。A number of ... 用作主语时，其谓语动词应用复数形式。注意不要
将两者混淆。试比较：

The number of people killed in the accident hasn’t been announced yet. 这次事故中

死亡的人数尚未公布。

A number of people are unhappy with this decision. 一些人对这项决定并不满意。

Unit 7  Teenagers should be allowed to choose their own clothes.
1.  No way! 不行！

这是英语口语中一个直接拒绝对方的表达用语，强调不赞同别人的观点，或根本没有

可能按其要求去做某事，具体意思类似于汉语的“不可能；不行”等。

另外，英语口语中还常用There’s no way ... 这样的惯用表达，用以陈述某人无法做某

事。例如：

121

Page PB

Notes on the TextThere’s no way I’m going to stay in a hotel for 800 yuan a night. That’s too expensive 

for me. 我根本无法去住 800 元一晚的宾馆，那对我来说太贵了。

There is, of course, no way to know for sure. 当然，没有什么办法能够得到确切的答案。
2.  Sixteen-year-olds should be allowed to get their ears pierced. 应该允许16 岁的孩
子穿耳洞。

此句中的 get 是使役动词，其搭配用法多种多样，这里接的是带有过去分词的复合结
构。get something done 是一个常见的固定搭配，常用来表达“请别人做某事；使某事完
成（自己也可能参与）”，something 与其后所接的done（过去分词）存在逻辑上的动宾关
系。例如：

Go and get your hair cut. 去找人理一下发。（相当于Go and get someone to cut your 

hair.）
3.  When I was a tiny baby crying all night, my mom sang to me and stayed by my 
side. 当我还是一个整夜哭闹的小宝宝时，妈妈会给我唱歌，陪伴在我身旁。

此句中的crying all night 是一个动词-ing 形式短语，用在名词baby 后面作定语，起修
饰名词的作用。由于本单元的语篇Mom Knows Best 属于诗歌体裁，文中运用了排比的修
辞手法，因此，动词-ing 形式短语作后置定语的现象在文中出现了多次。在初中阶段，学
生只需要理解这一结构在句子中的作用和含义即可，不必要求掌握或运用。

4.  Now I’m an adult, thinking back to those times. 现在我已长大成人，回想起那过去
的岁月。

此处名词times 意指“时光；岁月；时代”。除times 一词外，有时人们还会使用days

表达类似含义。例如：

People started to train and use the horse in ancient times. 在古代人们就开始驯养和

使用马匹了。

In those days, people used to write a lot more letters. 那时候人们更习惯写信。
5.  Only then will I have a chance to achieve my dream. 只有那样我才会有机会实现我
的梦想。

这是一个倒装句，正常语序是 I will have a chance to achieve my dream only then，

但由于与前文的连贯性及强调的需要，only then 被置于句首。

英语的句子大多主语在前，谓语在后。但在一些句子中，由于修辞或句子结构上的需

要，谓语被部分或完全置于主语之前，构成“倒装语序”。

only 用于句子的开头，后接副词、介词短语或状语从句时，句子应倒装。例如：
Only yesterday did he find out that his watch was lost. 直到昨天他才发现他的手表丢了。
Only after a year did I begin to see the results of my work. 直到一年后，我才开始看

到我工作的成果。

Unit 8 
1.  Well, where did you last put it? 那么，最后一次你把它（书包）放在哪里了呢？

本句中last 为副词，意思是“上次；最近的一次；最后一次”。last 除用于句末外，还

常置于句子中间。例如：

When I last saw her, she was working in Shanghai. 我上次见她时，她在上海工作。
When did you see him last? 你最近见到他是什么时候？

2.  I think somebody must have picked it up. 我想一定有人捡到它了。

此句情态动词 must 表示推测，意为“一定”。英语中当情态动词后接 have done 时，
表达对过去的事情进行推测，故must have done something 表示“过去一定做过了”这样
的意思。例如：

He’s playing outside. He must have finished his homework. 他在外边玩，一定已经把

作业做完了。

3.  Stonehenge 巨石阵

巨石阵位于英国伦敦西南 100 多公里索尔兹伯里平原上，是一处呈环形屹立的巍峨巨

石建筑遗迹，也是欧洲著名的史前时代文化神庙遗址。巨石阵是如何建造的、其目的何在

对现代人类来说仍是一个谜，这也正是巨石阵吸引人们之处。在英国人心目中，巨石阵是

一个神圣的地方，每年都有大量的游客前往观光，感受巨石阵的神奇魅力。

4.  For many years, historians believed Stonehenge was a temple where ancient 
leaders tried to communicate with the gods. 多年以来，历史学家们认为巨石阵是古代
首领用来与神灵沟通的一座神庙。

此句中的 where ancient leaders tried to communicate with the gods 是由关系副词

where 引导的一个定语从句，修饰名词temple。
5.  The large stones were put together in a certain way. 这些大块的石头以某种方式被
摆放在一起。

in a certain way 表示“以某种方式”，其中 certain 表达“某一；某个；某些”的意

思，仅用于名词之前。例如：

The doctor is only at this hospital on certain days. 那位医生只有在某些日子才在这所

医院里。

The library is only open at certain times of the day. 图书馆仅在一天的某些时段开放。
It’s wrong and dangerous to leave children under a certain age alone in the house. 把

某个年龄以下的孩子独自留在家中是不对而且危险的。

6.  As you walk there, you can feel the energy from your feet move up your body. 当
你走到那儿，你能感觉到（一股）能量从你的双脚上升到你的身体里。

123

Notes on the Text此句中的feel 是感官动词，其后可接宾语（the energy from your feet）和不带to 的动
词不定式充当的宾语补足语（move up your body），其用法与 see，hear，watch 等词一
样。再如：

We felt the house shake. 我们感到房子在晃动。

Unit 9 
I like music that I can dance to.
1.  Hmm, depends which movie. 嗯，取决于哪部电影。

1)  本句省略了 depends 前的主语 it 和 which movie 后的从句部分 we’ll watch，这是
典型的口语表达形式。在口语和非正式场合，为保持语言简洁明了，交流者往往会省略彼

此所知或逻辑上可明确推断的内容。例如：

Will come and meet you at around ten tomorrow morning. Hope you’ll get every-
thing ready. 明天上午 10 点左右前来见面。希望你把一切准备就绪。（省略 will 和 hope 前
的主语I）

Anything I can do for you? 我能为您做些什么吗？（省略句首部分Is there）
Please hand me one of those books; I don’t care which. 请把那些书递给我一本，不

管哪本都行。（省略句尾部分you hand me）

2)  It depends (on) who/what/how/whether ... 是一个常见句型。当 depend 后接短

语和从句时，口语中会省略depend 后的介词on，以求话语简练。例如：

It depends what day you catch me, and at what time of day. 这取决于你哪天见我，以

及见我的时间。

Well, as for this matter, I can’t decide for now. Depends whether or not your dad will 

say yes. 嗯，这件事我现在决定不了，取决于你老爸是否会同意。
2.  I just want to laugh and not think too much. 我只想笑一笑，不想过多费神思考。

这句话中的to laugh 和not think too much 均为动词不定式，但后者在not 和think 之
间省略了to。英语语句中当多个不定式结构并列使用时，to 出现在第一个结构中，后面的
往往会省略。再如：

She likes to sing, dance and hang out with her friends. 她喜欢唱歌、跳舞、与朋友们

外出消遣。

3.  When I’m down or tired, I prefer movies that can cheer me up. 当我心情不好或疲
惫时，我更爱看那些能使我高兴起来的电影。

此句中 down 为形容词，表示“不高兴；心情不畅；伤心”等，仅用于连系动词之后

作表语。又如：

He’s been feeling a bit down ever since he got his exam results. 从他获知自己的考试

成绩以来，他一直感觉有些郁闷不快。

124

Notes on the TextShe’s been really down since her husband died. 自从她丈夫去世后，她一直都很伤心

低落。

4.  The piece which was played on the erhu especially moved me. 那首用二胡演奏的
乐曲尤其使我感动。

此句中piece 表示音乐作品，相当于汉语的“一首歌；一支乐曲”等。例如：
When he was a small boy, he could hum songs and difficult pieces of music. 当他还是

个小孩子时，就会哼唱歌曲和颇有难度的乐曲。

I especially like that short piece by Beethoven. 我特别喜欢贝多芬的那首小曲。
5.  It is a pity that only six pieces of music in total were recorded for the future world 
to hear, but his popularity continues to this day. 遗憾的是，一共只有六首曲子被录了下
来得以传世，但时至今日，他（阿炳）依旧颇受欢迎。

popularity 在此表示“声望；知名度”之意。当我们说 to win popularity 或 to enjoy 

popularity 即指“享盛名；得众望；受欢迎”。再如：

Country music is growing in popularity. 乡村音乐正逐渐得到更多人的喜爱。

Unit 10  You’re supposed to shake hands.
1.  I held out my hand and to my surprise, she kissed me on both sides of my face! 
我伸出手来（想要握手），可令我吃惊的是，她居然亲吻了我的双颊！

kiss 为“亲吻”之意，既可作动词，也可作名词。作动词使用时，后面可接某人作宾
语，若需进一步说出所亲吻的部位时，再用介词 on 引入，即形成 kiss somebody on ... 结
构，本句便是如此。再如：

Will you kiss him? 你会吻他吗？
She kissed the child on the forehead. 她吻了孩子的额头。
当kiss 用作名词时，常用于give somebody a kiss on ...，例如：
She gave me a quick kiss on the cheek and said goodbye. 她在我面颊上轻快一吻，向

我道别。

2.  Where I’m from, we’re pretty relaxed about time. 在我们那个地方，我们的时间观
念比较随意。

此句中的where 用作连词，引导地点状语从句，说明主句行为发生的地点。例如：
Where I live, there are plenty of peach trees. 在我住的地方有很多桃树。
Remember to keep the kids where you can see them. 记住让孩子们待在你能看得见

的地方。

3.  We value the time we spend with our family and friends in our everyday lives. 我
们特别珍惜平日生活中和家人、朋友在一起的时光。

125

Page PB

Notes on the Text1)  动词value 表示“珍视；珍重；重视”等含义。例如：
I’ve always valued my teachers’ advice. 我一直很重视老师们所给的建议。
2)  life 在此句中的意义是“生活”，用作可数名词。例如：
Many people make different kinds of friends in their social lives. 许多人在他们的社交

生活中结交了各种不同的朋友。

一些常用短语和表达，如live/have/lead a ... life，常用life 的单数形式。如：
She just wanted to live a quiet life. 她只想过平静的生活。

4.  Also, we never visit a friend’s house without calling first. 而且，我们也从不事先未
通电话便登门拜访朋友。

这是一个双重否定的句子，其中 never 和 without 均表示否定，合在一起表达肯定的

意义，即“一定会”。这一点，英、汉两种语言表现相近。再如：

Some girls would never go out without taking time to dress themselves up. 有些女孩

不花些时间穿着打扮一番是不会出门的。

You will hardly ever be able to speak good English without practicing. 你不练习几乎

是不可能把英语说好的。

5.  Mind your manners! 注意你的礼仪！

1)  Mind ... 是一个警示句型，相当于汉语的“注意…… ；当心；小心……”。例如：
Mind your head, please! 请当心碰头！
Mind your step! 小心台阶！
2)  此句中 manners 意为“礼貌；规矩；礼节；礼仪”，在表达这一意义时，manner

通常用复数形式。例如：

have (no) manners 讲（不讲）礼貌；有（没有）礼貌；懂（不懂）礼貌
It’s bad manners to talk with your mouth full. 满嘴食物时说话是不礼貌的行为。
6.  You wouldn’t believe how quickly my French has improved because of that. 你简
直都想不到就因为这样我的法语提高得有多快。

You wouldn’t believe ... 是一个常用句式，相当于汉语所说的“你无法想象……；你
想都想不到……；你绝不会相信……”，表示所陈述的事情超出想象之外。与此类似的

表达还有You would never believe ... 或You would hardly believe ...。例如：

You wouldn’t believe that he found his long-lost sister in Taiwan! 你绝对想不到他在

台湾找到了失散多年的姐姐！

You would never believe what quick progress he’s made ever since he attended your 
class. It is a miracle! 您根本无法想象，自从他听了您的讲课后进步有多大。简直是个奇迹！
7.  My biggest challenge is learning how to behave at the dinner table. 我最大的挑战
是学习餐桌礼仪。

126

Notes on the Textlearning how to behave at the dinner table 是动词 -ing 形式短语，在句中作表语。

再如：

His main hobby is fishing. 他的主要爱好是钓鱼。
The most important thing is getting there in time. 最重要的事是及时到达那里。

Unit 11  Sad movies make me cry. 
1.  John: Did you have fun with Amy last night? 
	 Tina: Well ... yes and no ... 

  蒂娜：嗯，既开心又不开心……

  约翰：昨晚你和埃米玩得开心吗？

yes and no 表示对某一问题的两可回答，意思是“既是又不是；不能说定”。例如：
A: Were you surprised when you received something from Andy?你收到安迪的东西时

惊讶吗？

B: Well, yes and no. I knew he would send me something. But I just wasn’t sure what it 

would be. 嗯，既惊讶又不惊讶。我知道他会给我送东西，但是不知道他会送什么。
2.  Mmm ... why don’t you ask Alice to join you each time you do something with 
Julie? 嗯……每次和朱莉在一起的时候，你何不邀请艾丽斯加入呢？

这里 each time 引导时间状语从句，类似 each time 引导时间状语从句的连词还有

every time，next time 等。如：

Every time I come, he is busy. 每次我来他都很忙。
Next time you go skating, please wear warm clothes. 下次滑冰要穿暖和的衣服。

3.  Then she won’t feel left out. 那么她就不会觉得自己被冷落。

to be/feel left out表示“被遗忘；被忽略；被冷落；被抛弃”之类的意思。例如：
New fathers often feel left out when their baby arrives. 当自己的孩子出生时，那些新

爸爸们往往有被冷落的感觉。

If you don’t catch up, you’ll be left out. 如果你不抓紧赶上大家，你就会落在我们之后啦。

4.  His face was always pale as chalk. 他总是面色苍白。

(as) pale as chalk 是一种明喻修辞结构，虽然英语把苍白比作 chalk（白垩，一种白色

石灰岩），但汉语不可直译，相当于我们说的“惨白；苍白”。例如：

You look as pale as chalk today. What’s wrong? 今天你看着面色苍白，哪里不舒服？
另外值得注意的是，汉语描述不健康的人的面部颜色时常用“白”字，如“煞白；苍

白；灰白”等等，英语常用pale 来表达。例如：
He suddenly went pale. 他突然面色变白。

5.  How could he have missed scoring that goal? 他怎么没把球射进呢？

此句could have done 表示“过去本能够做某事却未做”，包含“责备”意义。又如：
How could he have been such a fool? 他怎么这么糊涂？

127

Notes on the TextHow could she have forgotten what kind of man he was? 她怎么能忘记他是哪种人呢？
6.  But whatever it was, don’t be too hard on yourself. 但不管结果怎样，不要对自己要
求太苛刻。

to be hard on somebody 是一个常用短语，表示“过于严格地要求某人；对某人过于

严厉”或“以刻薄的方式批评、对待某人”。例如：

Some teachers today are too hard on their students. 如今一些老师对学生的要求过于

严厉。

Perhaps I’m too hard on my daughter. 或许我对我女儿要求过头了。

7.  The next day, Peter went to soccer practice with courage rather than fear in his 
heart. 第二天，彼得并没有害怕，而是勇敢地去参加足球训练。

rather than 意思是“并非；而不是”。例如：
I, rather than you, should do the work. 该做这工作的是我，而不是你。
The most valuable thing is time, rather than money. 最珍贵的是时间，而不是金钱。
8.  But I think if we continue to pull together, we’re going to win the next one. 但我
想只要我们继续团结一致，我们就会赢得下一场比赛。

pull together 是一个常用短语，意思是“齐心协力；通力合作”。例如：
If all of us can pull together, there must be something we can do to improve the 

environment. 如果我们都能齐心协力，我们一定能做点什么来改善环境。

Unit 12  Life is full of the unexpected.
1.  I was about to go up when I decided to get a coffee first. 我正要上楼，这时我决定
先去买杯咖啡。

be about to do something是一种表达将来的结构。Somebody is about to do something
或Something is about to happen表示“某人即将做某事”或“某事就要发生”，表达的是一
种眼下的、最近的将来。例如：

We were just about to set off when Kate returned with the bad news. 我们正要出发，

这时凯特回来了，带来了坏消息。

Oh, I was just about to leave you a message. 噢，我正要给你写个留言条呢。
注意：be going to do something 表达对未来的“计划；打算”。例如：
We’re going to have a picnic this weekend. 本周末我们打算进行一次野餐。

2.  We stared in disbelief at the black smoke rising above the burning building. 我们
直愣愣地盯着燃烧着的大楼上升起的黑烟，无法相信（这一切）。

1)  stare 表示“（目不转睛地）盯着瞧；凝视”的意思，是不及物动词，用法与 look

类似，接宾语时需要用介词at 来引入所注视的内容。例如：

128

Notes on the TextWhat are you staring at? 你眼睛一动不动地在盯着看什么呢？
Don’t stare at people like that. It’s rude. 别那样盯着人看，这不礼貌。
2)  介 词 短 语 in disbelief 用 来 表 示 人 们 持 有 怀 疑、 疑 虑 的 态 度， 常 与 stare at 

somebody, shake one’s head 等搭配使用。例如：

I stared at him in disbelief, shocked at what he had said. 我直盯着他，十分震惊，不

相信他说的一切。

My grandmother shook her head in disbelief. 我奶奶摇着头，丝毫不信。

3.  April Fool’s Day 愚人节

这是英美等英语国家一个特有的娱乐性节日。每年 4 月 1 日，朋友、熟人间往往会无

中生有，编出一些玩笑来相互愚弄，人们一旦相信，便被大家嬉笑为“四月愚人”（April 
fool）。由于其特定的愉悦氛围和文化特质，这一节日深受大众，尤其是青年人喜爱，也
逐渐流传到世界其他国家。

4.  Many April Fool’s jokes may end up being not very funny. 许多愚人节玩笑的结局
并不是那么有趣。

end up 意为“结束；以……告终”，后面常接介词短语或动词的-ing 形式。例如：
Marley warns Scrooge to change his ways if he doesn’t want to end up like him. 马利

告诫斯克鲁奇，若是不想与他落得同样下场就得改变自己的行事方式。

He needs to think about what will happen if he doesn’t end up as a professional 

runner. 他需要思考，如果最终不能成为职业赛跑运动员会怎么样。

Every time she went to see that movie, she ended up crying her eyes out. 每次她去看

那部电影，最后都哭得跟泪人似的。

Unit 13  We’re trying to save the earth!
1.  So together, our actions can make a difference and lead to a better future! 因此，
我们齐心协力就能带来变化，创造更加美好的未来！

make a difference (to ...)表示“（对……）产生影响或作用”。例如：
Do you think his words would make any difference to the final decision? 你认为他的

话会对最后的决定产生影响吗？

The new teacher always encourages little Tom. This has made a big difference to him. 

新来的老师总是鼓励小汤姆，这对他影响很大。

2.  If their numbers drop too low, it will bring danger to all ocean life. 如果它们（鲨
鱼）的数目降至过低，会给所有海洋生物带来危险。

此句复数形式的 numbers 表达全球海洋中鲨鱼的总量。当表示数值的高或低时，

number 要用high 或low 修饰。例如：

129

Page PB

Notes on the TextIn that country, the number of children going to school is higher in cities than in 

towns and villages. 在那个国家，城市儿童入学人数比乡镇及农村要高。

常与number 搭配的动词有grow，fall 等。例如：
The number of families that own cars has been growing quickly recently. 近来拥有轿

车的家庭数量增长很快。

3.  Environmental protection groups around the world, such as WildAid and the 
WWF, are teaching the public about “finning”. 世界各地的环境保护组织，如野生救援
协会和世界自然基金会，都在教育公众有关“猎翅”（获取鱼翅而猎杀鲨鱼）的行为。

1)  英语中 fin 本为名词，指“鱼鳍”。此句的 finning 由动词化的 fin（割鲨鱼鳍以获
取鱼翅）的 -ing 形式转化而成，指课文中所陈述的“猎翅”（获取鱼翅而猎杀鲨鱼）这一
行为。

2)  WildAid 和WWF 组织
WildAid（美国野生救援协会）是保护野生动物及栖息地环境的一个非营利性的机构，
1999 年注册成立，其宗旨是保护及救助世界范围内的野生动物；WWF（世界自然基金会）
英文全称为 World Wide Fund For Nature，成立于 1961 年，是享有国际盛誉、全球最大
的独立性非政府环境保护组织之一。

4.  She lives in a house in the UK that she built herself out of rubbish. 她住在英国，
房子是她自己用废弃物建造而成。

that she built ... 是一个定语从句，修饰前面的名词house。
build/make ... out of ... 表示“用……建造 / 制作……”。例如：
This art piece is made out of glass. 这个艺术品是用玻璃做的。

5.  The top of the house is an old boat turned upside down. 房子的顶部是一条翻转过
来的旧木船。

此处过去分词短语 turned upside down 意为“被翻转过来的；被颠倒过来的”，用作
后置定语，修饰名词boat。英语中短语和从句用作定语时，一般置于名词之后，作后置定
语。例如：

the sign on the wall 墙上的标志牌（介词短语后置作定语）
the children boating on the lake 湖上泛舟的孩子们（现在分词短语后置作定语）
the stories invented by eight- and nine-year-olds 八九岁小孩子编写的故事（过去分词

短语后置作定语）

a machine that can do many kinds of housework 一个能做多种家务的机器（句子后

置作定语）

6.  Not only can the art bring happiness to others, but it also shows that even cold, 
hard iron can be brought back to life with a little creativity. 艺术不但可以给他人带来

130

Notes on the Text快乐，而且也说明只需要一点创造力，即便是冰冷、坚硬的铁也可产生活力。

not only ... but also ... 是一个并列连词，相当于汉语的“不但……而且……”。例如：
Basketball has not only become a popular sport to play but it has also become a 
popular sport to watch. 篮球不仅成为一项人们喜欢玩的运动，也成为一项人们喜欢观看
的运动。

Stonehenge is not only one of Britain’s most famous historical places, but also one of 
its greatest mysteries. 巨石阵不仅是英国最著名的历史古迹之一，也是英国最大的未解之
谜之一。

当not only ... but (also) ... 连接两个并列分句时， not only 后的分句用倒装语序。例如：
Not only did he hear it, but also he saw it. 他不但听见了，而且也看见了。
Not only does he speak English correctly, but he also speaks it fluently. 他不仅英语说

得正确，还说得流利。

I remember meeting all of you in Grade 7.

Unit 14 
1.  We have learned a different language 我们学习了一种不同的语言
  That is from a foreign land 它来自异国他乡

这两行诗句实为一个句子，从句that is from a foreign land 是language 的定语，表示
“一门来自异国的不同语言”。land 在此指“国家”，a foreign land 便是“外国”之意，但
这种说法多见于诗歌或散文等文学语言中。

2.  I’m trying to keep my cool 我在尽力保持冷静

keep one’s cool 意思是“保持沉着；不让自己失去控制”，cool 在此用作名词。例如：
“I must keep my cool,” she thought. “Losing my temper isn’t going to help.” 她想：

“我要保持冷静，发脾气是不会起作用的。”

与keep one’s cool 意思相似的还有keep cool。如：Keep cool! 保持冷静！
注意：keep cool 中的cool 用作形容词，而keep one’s cool 中的cool 为名词。

3.  As you set out on your new journey, you shouldn’t forget where you came from.

1)  set out on something 意思是“开始进行新的或重要的事情”。例如：

目时就知道它的难处。

2)  set out 是一个常用短语，表示“出发”。例如：
After a three-day rest, the travelers set out again. 这些旅行者休息三天后又出发了。

“（人生的）阶段或行程”。隐喻在英语中很常见，例如：

Grammar

I.   动词（Verbs）

1.   被动语态（Passive Voice）
1)	 主动语态和被动语态

英 语 动 词 有 两 种 语 态， 即 主 动 语 态（Active Voice） 和 被 动 语 态（Passive 
Voice）。当主语为动作的执行者时，谓语的形式为主动语态；当主语为动作的
承受者时，谓语要用被动语态。例如：

Many people speak English.（主动语态，句子的主语many people 是动作speak
的执行者）

English is spoken by many people.	（被动语态，句子的主语English 是动作speak
的承受者）

Bell invented the telephone in 1876.（主动语态）
The telephone was invented by Bell in 1876.（被动语态）

2)	 被动语态的构成

被动语态由“助动词be	＋及物动词的过去分词”构成。助动词be	有人称、数
和时态的变化，其变化规则与be	作为连系动词时完全一样。现以动词ask 为例，
将一般现在时和一般过去时被动语态的肯定式、否定式及疑问式列表如下：

肯定式

否定式

疑问式

一般现在时

I am asked …
He/She is asked …
We/You/They are 
asked …

I am not asked …
He/She is not asked …
We/You/They are not 
asked …

Am I asked …?
Is he/she asked …? 
Are we/you/they 
asked …? 

一般过去时

I was asked …
He/She was asked …
We/You/They were 
asked …

I was not asked …
He/She was not asked …
We/You/They were not 
asked …

Was I asked …?
Was he/she asked …?
Were we/you/they 
asked …? 

3)  含有情态动词的被动语态

含有情态动词的被动语态由“情态动词＋be ＋及物动词的过去分词”构成。例
如：

  Teenagers should be allowed to make their own decisions. 

150

 
 
 
 
Grammar

  Your room must be cleaned every day. 
  The trees may be planted behind the house. 
  This game can be played in the winter.

　  4)  被动语态的用法

当我们不知道谁是动作的执行者，或者没有必要说明谁是动作的执行者，	或者

只需强调动作的承受者时，要用被动语态。例如：

  The blouse is made of silk. 
  The zipper is often used in our daily lives. 
I think the TV was invented after the car. 
被动语态常用于陈述事实，一般用在科技文章或新闻报道中。

	*

2.   过去完成时（Past Perfect Tense）

1)	 过去完成时的构成

过去完成时由“助动词had（用于各种人称和数）＋过去分词”构成。

2)	 过去完成时的用法

 用法

例句

过去完成时表示在过去某一时间或动作
之前已经发生或完成了的动作。它表示
动作发生的时间是“过去的过去”。表示
过去某一时间可用 by, before 等构成的短
语，也可用 when, before 等引导的从句，
或者通过上下文表示。 

By the time I got outside, the bus had 
already left. 
When I got to school, I realized I had left 
my backpack at home. 
The movie had started before I arrived at 
the cinema. 
By the time I got to the airport, my flight 
had already taken off. 

注：had not	常简略为hadn’t。
3.   情态动词 （Modal Verbs）
	 很多情态动词都可以用于表达推测，但所包含的意义不尽相同。

1)  must  

must 表示很大的可能性，意为“一定；必定”，只用于肯定句中。
The backpack must belong to Carla. 那个背包肯定是卡拉的。	
It’s 10:00 p.m. He must be at home by now. 现在是晚上十点。他这会儿肯定在家。

2)  can 和can’t

can 常用于否定句或疑问句中表示惊异、怀疑、不相信等。can’t 表示“不大可
能”。例如：

Can it be true?	那可能是真的吗？
What can he mean?	他可能是什么意思呢？

151

Page PB

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Grammar

He can’t be more than 40.	他不可能超过四十岁。
I trust Joe. He can’t be lying.	我信任乔。他不大可能说谎。
除了上述情态动词以外，may, might, could 都能表示“可能”。could, might 语
气更委婉，might 语气最为缓和，含义更不确定。例如：
She looks beautiful. I think she may be an actress. 她看起来很漂亮。我觉得她可
能是个演员。

It could be Mei’s hair band. Or it might belong to Linda. They both have long 
hair.	这有可能是梅的发带，也有可能是琳达的。她们俩都是长发。

II.  宾语从句（Objective Clauses）

在复合句中，由一个句子充当宾语，这个句子叫作宾语从句。引导宾语从句的常见关

联词有that, if, whether, what, who, where, why 和 how 等。

关联词

例句

that（在口语或非正式
文体中常省略）

whether, if（在口语中
常用if）

who, what, which, 
when, where, how, why

I think (that) Halloween is a fun festival. 
Mary thinks (that) the teams were just fantastic. 
Many think (that) sharks are too strong to be 
endangered.

I wonder if/whether they’ll have the races again 
next year. 
Ben wonders if/whether April is a good time to 
visit Thailand. 

Could you please tell me where the restrooms are? 
Do you know when the bookstore closes today? 
I asked Candy how life was different after she 
became famous.
Can you tell me who she is? 

III.  定语从句（Attributive Clauses）

在复合句中，修饰某一名词或代词的从句叫作定语从句。定语从句通常置于它修饰的

名词或代词之后，被修饰的名词或代词叫先行词。例如：

I like music that I can dance to.
Carmen likes musicians who play different kinds of music. 
上面两句中的music 和musicians	是定语从句所修饰的词，叫作先行词，定语从句放
在先行词的后面。引导定语从句的词有关系代词 that, which, who（宾格 whom，所有格
whose）和关系副词where, when, why。关系代词和关系副词放在先行词和定语从句之间，

152

起联系作用，同时又作定语从句的一个成分。

由关系代词引导的定语从句：

关系代词

例  句

that 在从句中作
主语或宾语

which 在从句中
作主语或宾语

who, whom 在从
句中分别作主语
和宾语

指
物
或
指
人

指
物

指
人

I love movies that are funny.	（作主语）
April Fool’s Day is a celebration that takes place in different 
countries around the world. （作主语）
Everything (that) you learn becomes a part of you and changes you.	
（作宾语）
That’s the man (that) you are looking for.（作宾语）

The book which is on the table is mine.	（作主语）
The story (which) he told was very interesting. （作宾语）

I’d like to congratulate all the students who are here today.（作主语）
I love singers who write their own music.	( 作主语）
The person to whom you just spoke is Mr. Li.（作宾语）

注：关系代词在句中作宾语时常可省略。

IV.  构词法（Word Formation）

英语中很多单词的构成形式是有规律的，掌握单词的构成规律有助于理解和记忆词汇。

英语的常见构词法有合成（Compounding）、派生（Derivation）和转化（Conversion）。
缩写和简写（Abbreviation and Simplification）也是构词法的一种。

1.   合成法（Compounding）
	 由两个或两个以上的词合成一个新词，这种构词法叫作合成法。例如：

blackboard（形容词＋名词）
good-looking（形容词＋分词）

	 复合名词	classroom（名词＋名词）		
	 复合形容词	worldwide（名词＋形容词）	
	 复合动词	overcome（副词＋动词）
	 复合数词	fifty-four（数词＋数词）
	 复合代词	everything, somebody, anything（不定代词＋名词）
	 复合副词	downstairs（副词＋名词）
2.   派生法（Derivation）

在一个单词前面或后面加上一个词缀构成新词，这种构词法叫作派生法。加在单词

前的词缀叫前缀，加在后面的词缀叫后缀。

3.   转化法（Conversion）

一个单词由一种词类转换为另一种词类，这种构词法叫转化法。单词转化后的意义

往往与之前的意义联系密切。

名词转化为动词	

形容词转化为动词	

动词转化为名词	

show		n.	展览；展示	→	show		v. 表演；展出
water		n.	水	
slow		adj.	慢的	
walk		v.	散步；走	 →	take a walk		n.	散步
look		v. 看	

→	water		v. 浇水
→	slow		v. 放慢

→	have a look			n. 看一下，看一看

4.   缩写和简写（Abbreviation and Simplification）

缩写和简写（也被称为截断法或缩短法）主要采取“截头”“去尾”或者“既截头

又去尾”的方法来生成新词。例如：

airplane	→ plane	
advertisement	→	ad	

laboratory	→	lab	
examination	→	exam	

telephone	→	phone	
mathematics	→	math	
influenza	→	flu

154

另外，还有很多缩写词是由各个单词的首字母组成，例如：

CD (compact disk) 
CCTV (China Central Television)
NBA (National Basketball Association)

  UFO (unidentified flying object) 
  UN (United Nations)
	 USA (United States of America)
  WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature or World Wildlife Fund)
